My Client has built an impeccable reputation for integrity, professionalism, and ethical business practices in the industry, both nationally and internationally.\n\n2.  That My Client states that you, the Noticee, are the Editor-in-Chief of \"The Daily Sentinel\" News Portal, a news portal which has a wide readership/viewership and significant influence in the public domain.\n\n3.  That on or about **January 15, 2026**, you, the Noticee, maliciously and with the sole intention to defame and injure the reputation of My Client and his company, published/caused to be published a false, scandalous, and defamatory article/post titled **\"TechNova's CEO Linked to Shell Company Scam\"** on your website at the URL: https://www.dailysentinel.in/article/technova-scam-2026.\n\n4.
