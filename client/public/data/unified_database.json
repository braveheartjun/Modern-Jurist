JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR\nORAL JUDGMENT\n(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)\nDate : 15-02-2019\nHaving heard learned counsel for the parties, it appears that the views expressed by a learned Single Judge in the case of\nUpendra Rai Versus The State of Bihar & Another\nreported in\n2017(1) BBCJ 223\nand that in the case of\nRam Swarth Sah and\nothers Versus the State of Bihar & Another (Criminal Misc.\nNo.37156 of 2017)\ndecided on 06.09.2017, the learned Single\n1\n2/3\nJudge was of the opinion that since they project divergent views therefore, the matter deserves to be resolved as it is an issue of jurisdiction relating to the cognizance of the case being taken up at one place or the other.\nFrom a perusal of the order dated 07\nth\nFebruary, 2019, we do not find any discussion about the facts that gave rise to the judgement in the case of\nUpendra Rai\n(supra) or\nRam Swarth\nSah\n(supra). From a perusal of the two judgments, we find that the facts are different and are distinguishable and, therefore, the ratio of the respective decisions is based on the strength of the Supreme Court judgements relied in both the cases. It is evident that the ratio of the Supreme Court judgements have to be applied on the given set of facts of a particular case. The learned Single Judge has nowhere opined about the applicability of the law as declared by the Supreme Court to be applicable on the facts of the present case so as to gather any point of difference between the two cases relied upon by the respective parties.\nIn our considered opinion, it is always open to the learned Single Judge to decide on the basis of the facts of the case as to whether which of the two judgements would be applicable in order to arrive at a conclusion about the issue of jurisdiction. The point of difference, therefore, not having been indicated upon\n3/3\nperusal of the facts of the two cases, we do not find any need for answering the reference in view of what has been observed hereinabove. It has also not been indicated as to how the facts of the present case brings about a conflict so as to be resolved by us. It is open to the learned Single Judge to apply the law on the facts of the case as is applicable for deciding the controversy on its own merits.\nThe reference is accordingly returned to be placed before the learned Single Judge for proceeding in the matter in accordance with law.\n(Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, CJ)\n(Ashutosh Kumar, J)\nSunil/-\nAFR/NAFR\nCAV DATE\nUploading Date\n19.02.2019\nTransmission Date\n19.02.2019",

        "content": "Per : Shri A.K. Srivastava, Member (Technical) These appeals have been filed by M/s. E.I.H., Delhi (the appellants herein) against the Orders-in-Appeal No. 293 and 294/2000 dated 09.05.2000 passed by the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Mumbai. The Commissioner (Appeals), vide the impugned orders, rejected the appeals filed by the appellants and upheld the Orders-in-Original both dated 1.9.99 passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, Group VB, New Custom House, Mumbai by which the Deputy Commissioner had ordered that the appellants are not eligible for the benefit of Notification No. 64/93 CE dated 28.02.93 and, therefore, rejected their refund claims.\n2. Heard the learned SDR and perused the case records. None was present on behalf of the respondents inspite of notice. Since these are old cases of 2000, these are taken up for disposal by a common order as common facts and law are involved.\n3. The brief facts of the cases are that the appellants have imported 12 Nos. Mercedes Benz Cars and filed Bills of Entry No. 635 dated 2.1.1996 and 3372 dated 9.1.1996. Goods were assessed to duty under Chapter heading No. 8703 at the rate of 50% + 40% + 1/8% cess, which was the standard rate of duty. After clearance of the goods, as assessed by the Customs, the Appellants felt that the Customs have charged 40% C.V. Duty instead of 30% which is leviable in terms of the Notification No. 64/93 dated 28/2/93 and filed the Refund Claim for refund of the Additional Duty to the extent of 10%, which culminated in the impugned orders as referred to above.\n4. The appellants have relied upon the Honble Supreme Court Judgements in the cases of\nHyderabad Industries Ltd. Vs. Union of India\nreported in 1999 (108) ELT 321 (SC) and\nThermax Private Ltd. Vs. Collector\nreported in\n1992 (61) ELT 222 (SC\n) in support of their claim that they are entitled to the benefit of exemption under Notification No. 64/93 CE dated 28.2.1993.\n5. We find that an identical issue came up for consideration before the Tribunal in the case of\nRamniranjan Kedia Tourism Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Customs, New Delhi\nreported in\n2001 (42) RLT 717\n(CEGAT) in which it was held that further exemption in terms of proviso to Notification No. 64/93CE dated 28.2.93 is not available to the imported cars as it applies to the manufacturer and the importer cannot be treated as a manufacturer. While holding so, the Tribunal distinguished the Supreme Court Judgements in the cases of Thermax Pvt. Ltd. and Hyderabad Industries Ltd. (Supra). Although the appellants have claimed that an appeal in the case of Ramniranjan Kedia Tourism Services Pvt. Ltd. has been filed before the Supreme Court and the same is pending yet they have failed to produce the copy of Order, if any, passed by the Supreme Court even after a lapse of more than eight years. We are in total agreement with the findings of the Tribunal in the case of Ramniranjan Kedia Tourism Services Ltd., Supra and accordingly hold that the benefit of exemption under Notification No. 64/93 CE dated 28.02.93 is not available to the appellants and, therefore, the question of grant of refund does not arise.\n6. The impugned orders passed by the Commissioner (Appeals) are upheld. The appeals filed by the appellants are rejected. (Pronounced in court on ) A.K. Srivastava Member (Technical) Justice R.M.S.

        "content": "Heard. The applicant now submits that it is the mid academic session for his son studying in the 10th standard. But it appears that the applicant vide his letter dated 2.4.2013 had sought that his request for retention in station on educational grounds may be canceled. He now says that he was not knowing that several other had requested on the same grounds and were granted retention. Without knowing it, he has issued another letter requesting for deferment by 3 months till end of April 2013 and also transfer to Chennai or Secunderabad. Thereafter, the concerned officer made necessary arrangements for him to be transferred to Secunderabad, which was his place of choice. Now he would lament that wisdom has dawned on him and that there is possibility of his son loosing domicile rights if he is made to write his 10th Standard exam elsewhere other than Karnataka. He also produces a letter issued by the local authorities which indicates that there is severe shortage of Engineers in Bangalore and therefore they have recommended retention of the applicant, at least for one more year\n2. I have heard both the Counsel in great detail. After hearing them and in the light of the various Hon'ble Supreme Court Judgements, the following orders are issued:\n1. The applicant will be allowed to retain the quarter at Bangalore till 31.4.2014 without any penal consequences on him, so that his dependents can stay there, therefore his son can continue his education without any disturbance.\n2. The applicant will be relieved on 30.8.2013 and shall be allowed normal time for joining and other consequences of transfer also may be made available to him as per rules.\n3. That, in the interregnum period between the 30.8.2013 and the date of earlier order shall be treated as duty for all purposes.\n3.

        "content": "According to the latest statistical data available on cybercrime from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for the year 2022, cybercrime increased by 24.38 per cent compared to 2021.\nAs technology becomes an integral part of almost everything we do, including social media, online banking, and e-commerce, our dependence on digital systems has grown rapidly, but with this increased digital use comes more risk. Cybercriminals are finding new ways to misuse technology to commit fraud, identity theft, and harassment. These crimes not only cause financial loss but also damage someone’s reputation, identity, and mental well-being.\nThe Government of India, while answering to the question in the Lok Sabha on 6 August 2024, also reflected that the continuously increasing incidents of online transaction frauds and cybercrimes in the country have occurred during the last few years. In this article, we tried to understand the real cybercrime incidents and remedies available to the victims alongwith precautions in order to protect from these incidents.\n1\nAccording to the latest statistical data available on cybercrime from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for the year 2022, cybercrime increased by 24.38 per cent compared to 2021, which is a significant rise.\n2\nThe common cybercrime incidents are related to online transaction fraud, identity theft, deep-fake creation, online stalking, sextortion, fake social media profiles and job scams. Overall, cybercrime has become one of the biggest threats to personal security and public trust in today’s digital era. A few of the common cybercrimes that usually happen, and remedies to avoid them are discussed below:\n1.\nIdentity theft\n: Identity theft is the unlawful and dishonest use of another person’s identity and private information, such as a name, photo, or identification number (ID number), for one’s own benefit, usually with the intention of defrauding or defaming the person whose name is used. Many people now know that creating fake profiles or impersonating someone on social media to harm their reputation or attract attention is a common cybercrime, but they do not know how to get a remedy if they become the victim of that. Such acts can result in mental discomfort, embarrassment, and a loss of personal safety since private photos or information may be made public without consent. For instance, a man in Noida used a woman’s pictures to make a fake Instagram profile without getting her permission and attempted to blackmail her by sharing her personal photos. A first information report (FIR) was registered against him under Section\n66-C\n,\nInformation Technology Act, 2000\n, for identity theft. Later, the police discovered that her colleague had made the fake account.\n3\nWhenever anyone gets into this kind of situation, the victim can report the incidents on the “National Cybercrime Reporting Portal”, which is accordingly converted into FIRs and subsequent action thereon is handled by the State/Union Territory (UT) law enforcement agencies concerned.\n2.\nCyber fraud:\nCyber fraud is the illegal use of digital systems or data for financial gain. It may target individuals, companies, or even governmental organisations. Cybercriminals put individuals, companies, and governmental entities at risk by using technological flaws to commit online fraud and data breaches. For instance, a former employee of a private company was arrested for generating fake invoices to falsely claim input tax credit under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). He was booked under the\nNyaya Sanhita, 2023\nand the\nInformation Technology Act, 2000\n.\n4\nIn another instance, in Mangaluru, police discovered a gang that forged Aadhaar cards and tenancy documents to help accused individuals secure bail using fake identities. This case showed how digital forgery can harm the credibility of legal processes.\n5\n3.\nCyberstalking:\nPersistent online harassment, monitoring, or threatening messages are referred to as cyberstalking. The phrase itself implies that someone regularly monitors your online behaviour, even if they show no interest in you and occasionally, even specifically, instructs you not to message and follow. Usually, the accused would utilise a fake, or someone else’s account, to accomplish this. In an instance, 23-year-old man was sentenced to three years in prison for stalking a 15-year-old girl on WhatsApp. He sent obscene messages and threatened to harm himself if she did not reply. The court convicted him under Section\n354-D\n,\nPenal Code, 1860\nand Section\n11(4)\n,\nProtection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012\n(\nPOCSO Act\n)\n, along with fines and victim compensation.\n6\n4.\nDeep-fake technology:\nDeepfakes are artificial intelligence (AI) generated spoof images or videos intended to deceive or threaten people. This modifies reality and then deceives the audience and the person’s supporters. This is typically done to harm the individual emotionally and psychologically, as well as to tarnish their reputation. There is a similar concept of image morphing, where someone digitally alters a photo to change a person’s appearance, often to embarrass or defame them. This resulted in sextortion from the innocent, communal violence, and business dealings in the names of other famous people and celebrities.\nIn order to get protection from the deepfakes, citizens from throughout the country approach the Delhi High Court. As Delhi High Court is renowned for defending intellectual property rights. There is no culture like the one that emerged at the Delhi High Court to safeguard intellectual property anywhere in the country. This is the reason several celebrities petitioned this court to have their personality rights protected from AI-generated videos and altered photos. The Delhi High Court consequently issued a number of rulings in support of well-known people and celebrities to shield them from harm to their reputations caused by AI-generated videos.\nReported instance\n: One of the cases is of the famous journalist and editor-in-chief of DD News Sudhir Chaudhary, who also filed for the protection of personality rights before the Delhi High Court, where the Court has passed an interim order protecting the personality rights of the journalist from deepfake videos on YouTube from using in his name, image, likeness and voice, and regarding circulation of allegedly misleading and AI-generated videos against him on social media.\n7\nThe Delhi High Court recently addressed cases involving deepfakes and unauthorised use of celebrity images. The Court emphasised that personality rights, including names, voices, and likeness, should be legally protected under intellectual property principles.\n8\nIn a much-known instance, an influencer from Assam was targeted when her ex-boyfriend used AI tools to create sexually explicit deepfake images and sold them online. He earned nearly Rs 10 lakhs through subscriptions before being arrested. Police warned that sharing such fake content is also punishable.\n9\n5.\nOnline banking and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) fraud:\nThese are among the most common and fast-growing cybercrimes in India today, especially with the use of UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.).\nOnline transaction fraud typically occurs through gaming apps, betting apps, Telegram links, cryptocurrency platforms, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, and others. When a complaint about a fraudulent transaction is received by the cybercrime police or when they intercept it themselves, they mark the transaction on a layered basis and then proceed accordingly. If someone becomes a victim of online fraud and their account is marked under layers 1 and 2, there is a possibility of arrest, as the police can conduct searches and seizures, and may also call for the production of documents under Section\n94\n,\nNyaya Sanhita, 2023\n(\nBNSS\n)\n. Therefore, if someone is a victim of such a crime, they should file a representation with the cybercrime police and the bank. If the cybercrime police are from a different State, then send your grievance through email and speed post to get an appropriate response and understand the nature of the allegation imposed against you. Once you receive a reply to your representation and if the account hold exceeds the fraudulent transaction amount, you can request the bank to remove the lien or hold on the account due to enhanced due diligence (EDD). The victim can then instruct the bank to lift the hold on the account based on the cybercrime police report. You can also call on 1930 helpline number to know the reason for the lien or freeze\nof the account.\nMumbai Police in 2024 stated that they received 2000 to 2500 calls on a daily basis on the “1930” helpline number. After receiving the complaint, they transfer the complaint swiftly to the Nodal Police Officers of the banks, wallet or merchant concerned, to try and freeze the funds; who then coordinate and make every effort to save the money of the citizens.\nIn 2024, Mumbai Police reported an increase in UPI-related scams, where fraudsters sent fake payment links or one-time password (OTP) requests to trick victims into transferring money. Many scammers pretended to be buyers on platforms like OnLine eXchange (OLX) or Quikr. Victims were advised to never click on payment links or share OTPs and to verify UPI transactions directly on their bank app.\n10\n6.\nRansomware attacks on institutions:\nThese crimes lock down the data of businesses, companies, powerhouses, hospitals, or even universities and demand cryptocurrency or ransom payments. Sometimes they just sell it on the dark web. Attacks of this nature typically originate from foreign nations that wish to utilise the data to monitor other nations. They close the institutions in order to undermine the public’s trust in the government and give them more options, which led to a resurgence of industry and services throughout the nation. In 2023, sensitive patient data was compromised in a significant ransomware attack that shut down hospital servers for several days at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. The attack demonstrated how even important government agencies can become targets of cyberattacks.\n11\n7.\nJob scams and phishing e-mails:\nOnline job scams are becoming widespread, especially those promising remote work or part-time income. Fraudsters collect victims’ personal and sensitive data and take money for becoming members through fake offers.\nSometimes they even send the money into the innocent victim’s account by giving them false promise of a job where they give them a job of liking a post or sharing the post to other people, creating more accounts on their platforms, paying for viewing images for the certain times for which they reward them initially; when cybercrime raises the flag, to escape the liability of fraud, and real fraudsters show themselves as the victim and the real victim is treated as a fraudster by the police, and sometimes they even get arrested also.\nIn an instance in Hyderabad, the cyber police arrested a gang operating a fake job portal that offered “high-paying remote jobs”, requiring victims to pay a registration fee. Over 200 jobseekers were defrauded before the website was taken down.\n12\n8.\nCryptocurrency and investment frauds:\nNowadays, scammers defraud individuals by using phoney trading apps or bitcoin sites. In order to avoid taxes and government liability, the fraudsters use various digital platforms to create a fake screen that shows unimaginable profits from cryptocurrency and shares. They then start offering investment ideas to the inexperienced viewers and ask them to register on the phishing links, which either deduct their money initially or cause their accounts to be frozen later. And occasionally, they do not file a complaint against the same, as they are afraid of the inquiry being conducted against them.\nA Bengaluru-based tech worker lost Rs 12 lakhs in a cryptocurrency scam after being lured by a fake Telegram investment group promising high returns. The case showed how digital currency fraud is rising rapidly in India.\n13\n9.\nCyberbullying and online harassment:\nThe practice of bullying other users, including influencers, politicians and celebrities, is a global offense that has left no one unpunished. When it comes to leaving comments and messaging someone, there is no check and balance, just as there is no rigorous mechanism to restrict the same. However, in accordance with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Regulations\n, if someone objects, the corporation must remove it within the stipulated time frame; if they do not, they might face a fine of up to 200 crores.\nIn Pune, a teenage boy was booked for sending threatening messages and edited images to classmates on social media. The case raised awareness about the impacts of mental health and the importance of cyber ethics in schools.\n14\nDigital evidence and solutions\nVictims should always collect and preserve digital proof with original devices from which the evidence below can be collected. The following evidence is essential to show that someone is a victim of cybercrime during any investigation:\n1. Screenshots, chat history, and message logs.\n2. Uniform resource locators (URLs), usernames, and metadata of fake accounts.\n3. Reports from digital forensic analysis.\n4. Records of financial or communication activities linked to the crime.\nRemedies available to victims\nThe immediate steps that need to be taken if such cybercrimes occur, to secure personal and sensitive information, and other steps that need to be followed in order to prevent oneself from becoming a cybercrime victim; time being of the essence\n.\nImmediate steps for remedies\nOther steps\n1. Take screenshots and preserve history and chat records as proof of cyber offence.\n2. Report fake accounts and suspicious profiles immediately to the authorities concerned.\n3. Register a complaint on the cybercrime portal\nhttps://cybercrime.gov.in/\n.\n4. Call on “1930” helpline number to know the reason for the lien or freeze of the account.\n5. Also, approach the local police cyber cell in case of serious cybercrime has happened urgently.\n6. Report/notify the grievance professional of the social media platforms with respect to the cybercrime.\n1. Do not share excessive and sensitive personal information on social platforms.\n2. Always enable two-factor authentication to secure bank apps, email accounts, WhatsApp, and social media platforms.\n3. Keep updating passwords and security software, and device operating systems at a certain time interval to avoid any sort of compromise from anyone else logging in.\n4. Do not share OTP, download or click suspicious links shared by anyone, check on the network provided by the SIM company, where they clarify with genuineness of the link in case you want to log in.\n5. Regularly monitor the bank details, social media activity and where it was logged in before to detect unauthorised use.\nEnforcement authorities\n1. As per the direction issued by Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) relating to information security practices, procedure, prevention, response and reporting of cyber incidents under the provisions of sub-section (6) of Section\n70-B\n,\nInformation Technology Act, 2000\n, which mandate victims of cybercrime including service providers, intermediaries, data centres, body corporates and government organisation to mandatorily report cybercrime within six hours after getting the knowledge of such incidents.\n2. Cyber Crime Investigation Cells within police departments handle cases of cyber offences. The Ministry of Home Affairs has also set up the “Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre” (I4C) to deal with all types of cybercrime in the country, where we can also report our grievances for speedy and comprehensive investigation in a coordinated manner.\n3. The Data Protection Board enforces accountability and compliance for the exploitation of personal data on the data fiduciary, intermediaries and data under the\nDigital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023\n(DPDP)\n.\nCybercrime awareness and education\nCybercrime is a universal threat that transcends social, educational and economic boundaries. Both technologically adept and digitally inexperienced individuals remain vulnerable to online exploitation. Consequently, public awareness has emerged as a central pillar of national cybersecurity strategy.\nThe Government of India has consistently promoted public initiatives to mitigate the risks of cyber offences. These include awareness campaigns warning citizens against disclosing sensitive information such as OTPs and banking credentials.\n3\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) in collaboration with commercial banks, has also launched multimedia campaigns and television advertisements to educate users on secure digital banking practices. Hoardings, caller tune advisories, and online alerts further reinforce the importance of maintaining digital vigilance.\nNevertheless, awareness alone is insufficient without comprehensive digital literacy and preventive education. Citizens must be equipped with practical knowledge on identifying phishing attempts, verifying online platforms, and using two-factor authentication to safeguard personal and financial data.\nIt is also noteworthy that India observes National Cyber Security Awareness Month every October, serving as a timely reminder of the collective responsibility to maintain cyber hygiene and prevent digital exploitation.\n*Founding Partner, Chambers of Jain and Kumar.

        "content": "US Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit:\nAn appeal was filed by Robert Resnik and Resnik Music Group (appellants-defendants), challenging the judgment of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, which had declared Cyril E. Vetter and Vetter Communications Corporation (appelles-plaintiffs) to be the\nsole and exclusive owners of the copyright in the musical composition “Double Shot (Of My Baby’s Love)” throughout the world\nand questioning whether statutory termination under 17 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 304(c) and renewal rights under the Copyright Act of 1909 could operate beyond domestic (U.S.) copyright and extend to foreign exploitation rights. Smith, Stewart, Ramirez and Carl E. Stewart, JJ., affirmed the district court’s judgment in full, holding that statutory termination and renewal vested worldwide ownership in the Vetter Plaintiffs, and that the district court’s declaration was supported by statutory text, context, purpose, and governing copyright principles.\nThe dispute concerns ownership of the copyright in the song\n“Double Shot (Of My Baby’s Love)”\n(“Double Shot”), authored in 1962 by Cyril E. Vetter and Donald Smith in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 1963, both authors assigned 100% of their copyright interests, including renewal rights, to Windsong Music Publishers, Inc., for nominal consideration. The assignment expressly covers exclusive worldwide rights for the full term of copyright protection. Windsong later secured federal copyright registration under the Copyright Act of 1909, which provided an initial 28-year term with a contingent renewal term.\nDonald Smith died in 1972, prior to commencement of the renewal term and under settled copyright law, his renewal rights vested in his heirs rather than in Windsong. In 1994, the renewal term was duly registered, resulting in split ownership, wherein Windsong held Vetter’s renewal interest, while Smith’s heirs held Smith’s renewal interest. In 1996, Vetter Communications Corporation acquired Smith’s heirs’ renewal rights, thereby consolidating half the renewal of interest. The subsequent assignments resulted in Resnik Music Group claiming a 25% interest through Windsong’s successor entities.\nIn March 2019, Vetter served a statutory notice of termination under 17 U.S.C. § 304(c), terminating all rights originally granted to Windsong under the 1963 assignment, effective 03-05-2022. Despite receipt of the termination notice, Resnik continued to assert partial ownership. The dispute crystallised when ABC sought a worldwide digital license for the song, and competing ownership claims emerged.\nThe Vetter Plaintiffs instituted a declaratory action in the Middle District of Louisiana seeking confirmation of exclusive ownership. The District Court denied Resnik’s motion to dismiss, granted summary judgment in favour of the Vetter Plaintiffs, and declared them sole owners of the copyright throughout the world, both by virtue of termination (Vetter’s recaptured interest) and renewal (VCC’s acquired interest). Thus, the present appeal was filed arguing that statutory termination and renewal could not affect foreign copyright rights.\nThe Court observed that the core issue was not infringement but ownership but whether rights “arising under” U.S. copyright law could be geographically bifurcated upon termination or renewal.\nThe Court noted that 17 U.S.C. § 304(c)(6)(E) limits termination only as to rights arising under “any other Federal, State, or foreign laws,” but does not impose a territorial restriction on rights that arise under the U.S. Copyright Act and are recognised internationally pursuant to treaty obligations.\nThe Court stated that the phrase “arise under this title” refers to the source of the rights, not their geographic reach. As the original worldwide grant stemmed from U.S. copyright law, termination necessarily restored the same bundle of rights that had been conveyed. The Court relied on principles articulated in\nKirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons\n, 568 U.S. 519 (2013) endorsing a non-geographical interpretation of similar statutory language.\nThe Court analysed competing authorities, including\nSiegel v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc\n., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (C.D. Cal. 2008),\nFred Ahlert Music Corp. v. Warner/Chappell Music, Inc.\n, 155 F.3d 17 (2d Cir. 1998), and\nClancy v. Jack Ryan Enterprises, Ltd.\n, No. 17-CV-3371, 2021 WL 488683 and declined to follow them, holding that those cases relied heavily on non-binding treatises and conflated infringement-based territoriality with ownership questions. The Court further rejected the argument that termination or renewal violated international treaty obligations under the Berne Convention or the Universal Copyright Convention, holding that worldwide recognition of a copyright granted under U.S. law is consistent with national treatment and does not offend territoriality principles. The Court emphasised that statutory termination and renewal serve the remedial purpose of correcting unequal bargaining power and ensuring fair remuneration to authors and their heirs.\nThe Court remarked that\n“Supreme Court has described the purpose of the Copyright Act of 1909, which was ‘to give the author a second chance to obtain fair remuneration for his creative efforts and to provide the author’s family a Ê»new estate’ if the author died before the renewal period arrived.’ This purpose is consistent with the Vetter Plaintiff’s argument and the district court’s holding that Vetter Communications Corporation is the sole owner of Double Shot’s copyright throughout the world in VCC’s Renewal Copyright Interest. Only by recapturing the exclusive rights to Double Shot throughout the world rather than recapturing U.S. rights alone would Vetter Communications Corporation receive fair remuneration consistent with the purpose of the Copyright Act of 1909. Thus, the district court did not err based on the statutory text and purpose.\n”\nThe Court held that Cyril E. Vetter, by valid statutory termination under 17 U.S.C. § 304(c), recaptured exclusive worldwide rights in the copyright originally assigned, and that Vetter Communications Corporation, by operation of the renewal provisions of the Copyright Act of 1909, held a new and unencumbered worldwide copyright estate. Consequently, the Vetter Plaintiffs were correctly declared the sole owners of the copyright in “Double Shot (Of My Baby’s Love)” throughout the world, and the judgment of the district court was affirmed in its entirety.\n[\nCyril E. Vetter v Robert Resnik,\n2026 SCC OnLine US CA 5C 1\n, decided on 12-01-2026\n]",

        "content": "Till date, a central legal question remains at large: What is cryptocurrency and what is its legal character? Is it goods, a security, or a currency?\nIntroduction\nFor years, the Indian approach to cryptocurrency could be summed up in one word: uncertain. While the government and regulatory bodies have not imposed an outright ban, they have maintained a stance of cautious scepticism, navigating a complex path that balances burgeoning innovation with systemic risks. This creates a peculiar environment where crypto is not illegal, yet it is not fully regulated either, leaving investors, businesses and the legal system in a state of limbo.\nEarly RBI warnings and regulatory anxiety\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) was among the earliest institutions to express concern about cryptocurrency dealings in the country. In December 2013, it issued a cautionary press release warning users that virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple posed financial, legal and security risks.\n1\nRBI clarified that these digital coins were not authorised by any monetary authority in India and that users transacted at their own peril.\nDespite of the warning, the market grew. Cryptocurrency exchange platforms like Binance, Zebpay and WazirX emerged, Indian investors began trading millions in digital assets and advertisements promoting crypto investments became common. Alarmed by this pace, RBI in April 2018 issued a circular directing all regulated entities including banks and payment service providers not to deal with or provide any services related to virtual currencies.\n2\nThis effectively cut off crypto exchanges from the banking system.\nThe Supreme Court’s intervention: freedom to trade in virtual assets\nThe regulatory chokehold was challenged in the Supreme Court by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). The petitioners argued that the RBI circular was arbitrary, disproportionate, and violated the constitutional right to carry on trade under Article\n19(1)(\ng\n)\nof the\nConstitution\n.\nIn\nInternet and Mobile Assn. of India\nv.\nRBI\n3\n, the Supreme Court held that while RBI had the authority to regulate virtual currencies, a complete exclusion from the banking system was disproportionate, especially when no law prohibited cryptocurrency trading itself. The circular was, therefore, struck down.\nThis judgment was not an endorsement of cryptocurrencies. Rather, it was an affirmation of constitutional proportionality. The Court held that regulation must be reasonable, evidence-based and minimally invasive. This decision reopened banking channels for exchanges and restored investor confidence. It also clarified a crucial legal point: Holding or trading cryptocurrency in India is not illegal.\nClassification dilemma: What exactly is cryptocurrency?\nTill date, a central legal question remains at large: What is cryptocurrency and what is its legal character? Is it goods, a security, or a currency?\nEach classification carries different implications:\n1. As goods, it attracts GST and general contract laws.\n2. As a security, it falls under SEBI’s jurisdiction.\n3. As a currency, it comes within RBI’s domain.\nThe lack of clarity causes fragmented compliance and litigation risks. Courts and regulators must eventually evolve a\nsui generis\nclassification for virtual digital assets to ensure consistency.\nLegal status: not illegal, yet not legal tender\nHowever, being “not illegal” is far from being “legal tender”. The Government of India has consistently clarified that cryptocurrencies are not recognised as currency. No one is bound to accept them as payment. They function instead as digital assets, similar to gold or shares. Thus, crypto may be owned, traded and held, but not used as money in the legal sense. In the absence of a dedicated cryptocurrency law, regulation occurs indirectly through multiple statutes and notifications.\nThe Union Budget 2022 was a turning point, introducing a new tax regime for Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs). It imposed a flat 30 per cent tax on gains from VDA transfers, along with a 1 per cent Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on transactions above a certain threshold.\n4\nThis established crypto as a recognised asset class for tax purposes, though not as legal tender.\nIn 2023, the Union Government brought Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), including exchanges and wallet providers, under the purview of the\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002\n(PMLA)\n5\n. This mandated stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) norms and reporting obligations, bringing India’s framework closer to global standards.\nAbsence of a comprehensive statute\nIndia still lacks a specific law dealing with cryptocurrencies. The proposed “Banning of Cryptocurrency and regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019\n”\nwhich sought to criminalise private crypto holdings was never tabled. Later drafts hinted at a softer stance, promoting blockchain technology but discouraging private tokens.\nIn 2025, reports suggest that the Government of India is holding back comprehensive regulation due to concerns about systemic risks, financial instability and monetary sovereignty. Policymakers have emphasised the need for global consensus through forums like the G20 and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) before finalising a domestic law.\nIn contrast, RBI is actively pursuing its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), known as the e-Rupee, a sovereign digital alternative that embodies blockchain benefits while preserving State control.\nKey issues and challenges\nDespite regulatory progress, several issues continue to plague the Indian crypto landscape:\n6\n1. Legal ambiguity and fragmented regulation\n: The biggest challenge remains the lack of a clear, comprehensive law. The current regulatory structure is fragmented, with different bodies (Ministry of Finance, RBI, Financial Intelligence Unit) overseeing various aspects like tax, monetary stability and compliance. This creates uncertainty for businesses and investors alike.\n7\nOn 19 May 2025, while hearing a bail petition, the Supreme Court questioned the Central Government’s prolonged inaction on cryptocurrency regulation. The court remarked that the absence of a clear legal framework has created a “fertile ground” for misuse, with unregulated trading being a “more polished form of\nHawala\n,” or illegal money transfers.\n8\nThe potential over-regulation could push tech talent and startups to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions, causing India to lose its competitive edge in a rapidly growing global industry.\n2. Taxation hurdles\n: While a tax regime provides clarity, its current form presents significant challenges. The flat 30 per cent tax on gains, coupled with no allowance for set-off of losses, makes trading highly expensive and potentially unviable. This stifles frequent trading and may drive investors towards unregulated channels.\n3.\nInvestor protection and consumer recourse\n: With no clear legal framework, investor protection remains limited. In case of scams, hacks, or exchange failures, there is no formal dispute resolution mechanism or established recourse available to customers. Offshore exchanges, which many Indian investors use, further complicate jurisdictional issues, making legal remedies difficult and costly to pursue.\n9\nConstitutional and jurisprudential dimensions\nThe Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in\nInternet and Mobile Assn. of India\n10\nset an important precedent in administrative law. It reaffirmed that even economic regulations must pass the test of proportionality, balancing public interest against individual freedom. This doctrine, drawn from\nModern Dental College\nv.\nState of M.P.\n11\nand\nK.S. Puttaswamy\nv.\nUnion of India\n12\n, requires that any restriction must have a legitimate purpose, be necessary and be the least restrictive measure available.\nApplied to cryptocurrency, the principle implies that outright bans would likely fail judicial scrutiny unless supported by strong empirical justification.\nImplications for the legal system\nFor lawyers and judges, cryptocurrency introduces novel questions: How does one prove ownership of an asset that exists only on a blockchain? What constitutes delivery, transfer or breach in a smart contract? Can crypto wallets be attached or seized under Section\n85\n,\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita\n?\nThese questions will soon reach Indian courts. The answers will shape not only the crypto industry but also the future jurisprudence of digital property.\nConclusion\nIndia’s approach to cryptocurrency mirrors its broader philosophy towards technology—cautious, incremental and constitutionally grounded. There is no law banning crypto; yet, it is not legal tender. It is taxed, monitored and occasionally prosecuted, but not fully regulated. This coexistence amid uncertainty defines India’s crypto story.\nThe coming years must transform this uncertainty into clarity, through legislation that protects consumers, ensures transparency, and nurtures innovation without compromising the financial system. As India stands at the crossroads of digital transformation, the law must not merely react to technology; it must lead it.\n*Civil Judge (Senior Division).

        "content": "On 20-1-2026, the Ministry of Power issued the draft of\nNational Electricity Policy (NEP) 2026\n, introducing a framework that ensures reliable affordable and sustainable electricity supply. It aims to bring transformation to power sector aligning with the vision of\nViksit Bharat @2047\n.\nThis Draft policy invites suggestions from stakeholders before 19-2-2026, which can be submitted at\nrr1-mop@gov.in\n.\nBackground:\nThe\nfirst National Electricity Policy\nwas introduced in 2005 when power sector faced fundamental challenges such as demand—supply deficits, low access to electricity, insufficient private participation, and underdeveloped infrastructure.\nSince then, following transformations were noted:\nInstalled generation capacity has\nincreased fourfold\n, driven significantly by private sector participation.\nUniversal electrification\nwas achieved in\nMarch 2021\n.\nA\nunified national grid\nbecame operational in\nDecember 2013\n.\nPer capita electricity consumption rose to\n1,460 kWh in 2024—25\n.\nPower exchanges and markets evolved, enhancing efficiency and procurement flexibility.\nHowever, despite these achievements, persistent systemic issues remain related to distribution segment. DISCOMs continued to face:\nHigh accumulated losses and debt\nTariffs that are often non-cost-reflective\nHeavy cross-subsidisation leading to\nelevated industrial tariffs\n, affecting global competitiveness\nIn response to deal with these backdrops Power Ministry has drafted\nNEP 2026\nwhich aims to achieve the set milestones to sustain growth and ensure long-term sustainability:\nPer capita electricity consumption:\n○ 2,000 kWh by 2030\n○ 4,000+ kWh by 2047\nClimate alignment:\n○ 45% reduction in emissions intensity from 2005 levels by 2030\n○ Net-zero emissions by 2070\nKey Takeaways of National Electricity Policy:\nNational Electricity Policy\nis introduced in compliance with\nElectricity Act 2003\n, replacing the earlier\nNational Electricity Policy of 2005\n.\nTo ensure planned and reliable capacity expansion:\nDISCOMs and SLDCs will prepare utility- and state-level Resource Adequacy (‘RA’) plans under State Commission regulations.\nThe Central Electricity Authority (‘CEA’) will consolidate these into a national RA plan.\nThe draft emphasizes restoring the sector’s financial health:\nIndexed tariffs with automatic annual revisions where State Commissions delay orders.\nProgressive recovery of fixed costs through demand charges to reduce cross-subsidisation.\nExemption from cross-subsidies and surcharges for manufacturing industries, railways, and metro rail to boost competitiveness.\nRegulatory Commissions may exempt distribution licensees from Universal Service Obligation for consumers with contracted load â‰¥ 1 MW.\nStrengthening dispute resolution mechanisms to reduce burdens on regulators and consumers.\nTo accelerate India’s clean energy transition:\nRenewable Energy\n(‘RE’) capacity addition via market-based mechanisms and support for captive RE projects.\nStorage installation by distribution licensees on behalf of small consumers to leverage economies of scale; bulk consumers may install their own storage.\nAllowing peer-to-peer (P2P) trading of surplus DRE energy and storage through aggregators.\nParity between RE and conventional sources in scheduling and deviation by 2030.\nPromotion of market-based deployment of storage, BESS technologies, and domestic manufacturing of cells and components.\nDemand-side support such as\nViability Gap Funding\n(‘VGF)’ for BESS and pumped storage.\nThe sector advances toward a low-carbon future, but thermal power will continue to play a role:\nIntegration of storage solutions with thermal plants.\nRepurposing older units for grid support and improved reliability.\nExploring direct use of thermal plant steam for district cooling and industrial processes.\nThis policy is in line with the\nSHANTI Act, 2025\n, supporting:\nAdoption of advanced nuclear technologies\nDevelopment of Modular and Small Reactors\nUse of nuclear energy by commercial and industrial consumers\nA target of 100 GW nuclear capacity by 2047\nTo expand storage-based clean energy:\nAccelerated development of storage-based hydroelectric projects\nFocus on flood moderation, irrigation, and overall water and energy security\nThe policy calls for accelerated storage-based hydropower development, strengthened market surveillance, and modernized transmission systems using advanced technologies, fair RoW compensation, RE tariff parity by 2030, and utilisation-based connectivity to prevent speculative holding.\nIt promotes achieving single-digit AT&C losses, adopting shared distribution networks, establishing DSOs for RE-storage-V2G integration, ensuring N-1 redundancy in large cities by 2032, implementing underground networks in congested areas, and improving grid governance through STU unbundling and alignment with the Indian Electricity Grid Code.\nIt mandates strong\ncybersecurity measures\n, compulsory domestic storage of power-sector data, structured data-sharing with real-time DER visibility, and a transition to indigenous SCADA systems by 2030 along with domestic development of all critical power-system software.",

        "content": "Supreme Court:\nWhile considering the bail pleas of Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid, Shifa Ur Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed and Gulfisha Fatima who were booked under several provisions of\nPenal Code, 1860\n,\nUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967\n(UAPA), Arms Act and\nPrevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984\n, for their alleged involvement in 2020 Delhi NCR communal riots and larger conspiracy; the Division Bench of\nAravind Kumar*\nand N.V. Anjaria, JJ., refused to grant bail to\nSharjeel Imam\nand\nUmar Khalid\n, expressing satisfaction that the prosecution material prima facie discloses attribution of a central and formative role by the 2 accused persons.\nVis-a-vis\nShifa Ur Rehman\n,\nMohd. Saleem Khan\n,\nMeeran Haider\n,\nShadab Ahmed\nand\nGulfisha Fatima\n, the Court decided to grant them conditional bail having regard to the role attributed, the nature of the material relied upon, and the present stage of the proceedings.\nBackground:\nIn February 2020, Delhi NCR was gripped by violence and communal tensions owing to riots, which subsequently led to registration of FIR. The prosecution alleged a pre-planned criminal conspiracy involving several accused persons, including the 7 appellants (accused persons). It was alleged that the conspiracy was hatched with the object of orchestrating riots in the National Capital Territory of Delhi as a form of protest against the enactment of the\nCitizenship Amendment Act, 2019\n(CAA)\nand the proposed\nNational Register of Citizens (NRC)\n. It was further alleged that the conspiracy culminated in the deliberate incitement of widespread communal violence on and around 22nd, 23rd, and 24\nth\nFebruary 2020. The acts allegedly committed during this period were not spontaneous but were the outcome of coordinated efforts to inflame tensions, mobilise crowds and execute violent actions across various parts of Delhi. The riots resulted in grave consequences, including the loss of 54 lives, among them a senior police officer and an Intelligence Bureau official, as well as grievous injuries to several police personnel and civilians. In addition, extensive damage was caused to over 1,500 public and private properties, alongside substantial intangible harm to public order, social harmony, and the nation at large.\nConsequently, the accused persons were apprehended, investigations began and upon completion of investigation, a chargesheet came to be filed alleging offences under Sections 120B read with Sections\n109\n,\n114\n,\n124-A\n,\n147\n,\n148\n,\n149\n,\n153-A\n,\n186\n,\n201\n,\n212\n,\n295\n,\n302\n,\n307\n,\n341\n,\n353\n,\n395\n,\n420\n,\n427\n,\n435\n,\n436\n,\n452\n,\n454\n,\n468\n,\n471\nand\n34\nof the\nIPC\n; Sections\n13\n,\n16\n,\n17\nand\n18\nof the\nUAPA, 1967\n; Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act and Sections\n3\nand\n4\nof the\nPrevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984\n.\nCourt’s Assessment:\nPerusing the case, the Court made its assessment under the following heads:\nProlonged incarceration and plea under Article 21\nThe Court noted the accused persons’ plea regarding prolonged incarceration, coupled with the absence of any realistic prospect of early conclusion of trial, which rendered continued detention constitutionally impermissible. The Court clarified that under the contours of UAPA, the plea of delay engages Article 21 at two distinct constitutional planes.\nFirst\n, delay may be of such magnitude that continued detention becomes per se unconstitutional, irrespective of the strength of the prosecution case.\nSecond\n, delay may be pressed as a circumstance to contend that the statutory satisfaction under Section 43D(5) stands diluted or displaced.\nThe present case, on an examination of the record, does not meet either threshold\n. The Court explained that the constitutional inquiry into delay is not an inquiry into guilt. It is an inquiry into whether continued detention remains constitutionally permissible in the circumstances of the case. That inquiry is necessarily contextual. The Court further pointed out that it is conscious that the accused persons in the present appeal may not stand on identical factual footing in all respects with the co-accused whose appeal was considered by the High Court.\nNoting cumulatively, the Court observed that the record did not support the absolute proposition that the accused persons have remained “innocently incarcerated” without any contribution to delay, nor does it disclose a situation where the delay is so wholly unjustified as to override the statutory embargo contained in Section 43D(5). The plea of delay in the facts of the particular case, therefore, does not warrant enlargement on bail, though it justifies continued judicial emphasis on the timely conduct of the proceedings.\nFramework of Section 43D(5) UAPA and scope of judicial enquiry at bail stage\nThe Court explained that the expression “prima facie true”, which lies at the heart of Section 43D(5), does not invite a detailed examination of evidence, nor does it require the Court to assess the probability of conviction. Equally, it does not reduce the judicial role to a mechanical acceptance of the prosecution’s assertions. The statutory standard contemplates a threshold inquiry of limited but real content. The discipline imposed by Section 43D(5) necessarily circumscribes the nature of judicial scrutiny permissible at the bail stage.\nAny exercise approximating a mini-trial at this stage would transgress the statutory boundary deliberately drawn by Parliament\n. The Court enumerated the enquiries that should be undertaken for Section 43D(5).\nScope of “terrorist act” under Section 15 UAPA and statutory context\nThe Court explained that the prima facie satisfaction contemplated by Section 43D(5) is not a matter of impression or gravity alone; it is a satisfaction referable to defined statutory ingredients. Section 15 of the Act defines what constitutes a “terrorist act” for the purposes of the statute. The definition is structured around two essential elements. First, the act must be done with intent to threaten, or be likely to threaten, the unity, integrity, security, including economic security, or sovereignty of India, or with intent to strike terror in the people or any section thereof. Second, the act must be of such a nature as to cause, or be likely to cause, the consequences enumerated in the provision.\n“To construe Section 15 as limited only to conventional modes of violence would be to unduly narrow the provision, contrary to its plain language”\n. Furthermore, read together, Sections 15 and 18 disclose a legislative design wherein Section 15 defines the nature of acts which Parliament has characterised as terrorist acts, while Section 18 ensures that criminal liability is not confined only to the final execution, but extends to those who contribute to the commission of such acts through planning, coordination, mobilisation, or other forms of concerted action.\nIndividualised role and differentiation in treatment of the prime conspirators with others\nThe Court observed that the record disclosed that\nall the accused persons do not stand on an equal footing as regards culpability\n. The allegations against the principal accused indicate a central and directive role in conceptualising, planning, and coordinating the alleged terrorist act, whereas the material against certain co-accused reflects conduct of a subsidiary or facilitative nature. The hierarchy of participation, emerging from the prosecution’s case itself, requires the Court to assess each application individually, rather than proceed on the premise of equivalence. Such differentiation is intrinsic to criminal adjudication and operates irrespective of the uniformity of charges framed.\nThe Court noted that against Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, the prosecution material comprises direct, corroborative, and contemporaneous evidence, including recoveries, digital communication trails, and statements indicative of managerial responsibility. In contrast, the involvement of others is sought to be established mainly through associative or peripheral conduct. The Court cannot ignore that where evidentiary strength varies materially between accused persons, the need for continued detention likewise varies. The Court further observed that a cumulative and comparative reading of the FIR and the successive charge-sheets disclosed a discernible differentiation in the nature, scope, and hierarchy of roles attributed to the accused persons. This structural distinction cannot be ignored and must inform any judicial determination relating to culpability, parity, or the applicability of penal provisions requiring a heightened threshold of intent and participation. “\nHaving thus delineated the structural and evidentiary differentiation emerging from the prosecution case itself, it becomes necessary for the Court to examine the bail pleas in an accused-specific manner. The exercise that follows is not one of adjudicating culpability, which lies exclusively within the domain of trial, but of assessing whether the statutory threshold governing pre-trial liberty is attracted qua each appellant”\n.\nThereafter, the Court proceeded to consider the submissions made by the 7 accused persons, the respondents and findings made by the Trial Court and Delhi High Court.\nConclusion and Operative Directions:\n“When bail is sought in prosecutions governed by a special statute, the Court is required to undertake a difficult and sensitive balancing exercise, conscious that neither liberty nor security admits of absolutism”.\nAccused Persons who were Denied Bail\nDeclining bail to Sharjeel Imam and Umar Khalid, the Court stated that the material suggests involvement at the level of planning, mobilisation, and strategic direction, extending beyond episodic or localised acts. The statutory threshold under Section 43D (5) of the UAPA, therefore stands attracted qua these appellants. The Court opined that\nit was not persuaded that, on the present record, continued detention has crossed the threshold of constitutional impermissibility so as to override the statutory embargo.\nThe complexity of the prosecution, the nature of evidence relied upon, and the stage of the proceedings do not justify their enlargement on bail at this juncture. Hence, their appeals were rejected.\nThe Court further opined that on the completion of the examination of the protected witnesses relied upon by the prosecution, or upon the expiry of a period of one year from the date of this order, whichever is earlier, these two accused persons would be at liberty to renew their prayer for grant of bail before the jurisdictional Court.\nAccused Persons who were Granted Conditional Bail\nThe Court allowed the appeals of the remaining 5 accused persons and emphasised that the grant of bail in their favour does not reflect any dilution of the seriousness of the allegations, nor does it amount to a finding on guilt. It represents a calibrated exercise of constitutional discretion, structured to preserve both liberty of the individual and security of the nation.\nThe Court directed their release subject to certain conditions including executing a personal bond in the sum of ₹2,00,000 with two local sureties of the like sum to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.\nConcluding Remarks:\nThe Constitution guarantees personal liberty, but it does not conceive liberty as an isolated or absolute entitlement, detached from the security of the society in which it operates. Where a special statutory framework has been enacted to address offences perceived to strike at these foundations, courts are duty-bound to give effect to that framework, subject always to constitutional discipline. Those alleged to have conceived, directed, or steered unlawful activity or terrorist activity stand on a different legal footing from those whose alleged involvement is confined to facilitation or participation at a different level. To disregard such distinctions would itself result in arbitrariness.\nThe\nCourt clarified that it has not examined the merits of the prosecution case beyond the confines mandated at the stage of consideration of an application seeking bail\n, nor has it expressed any opinion on the ultimate culpability of any of the accused. All observations are confined to the material presently on record and to the statutory and constitutional standards governing pre-trial liberty under a special enactment.\nHaving regard to the nature of the prosecution and the period of incarceration already undergone, the Court directed that the Trial Court shall proceed with the matter with due expedition and shall endeavour to ensure that the examination of witnesses, particularly the protected witnesses relied upon by the prosecution, is taken up and carried forward without delay. Prosecution shall take all necessary steps to secure the presence of its witnesses on the dates fixed and the parties shall refrain from seeking adjournments except for reasons which are unavoidable. The Trial Court shall be at liberty to regulate the proceedings in accordance with law so as to ensure that the trial is not unnecessarily prolonged, while at the same time safeguarding the rights of all parties.\n[\nGulfisha Fatima v.

        "content": "1. To begin with, please introduce yourself to our readers and share a brief overview of your journey in the legal profession.\nI am Dr Hemant Gupta, a practising Advocate in the Supreme Court of India. I have done my LLB from Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, which is also my native place. After doing my LLB, I got enrolled with the Bar Council of Punjab & Haryana, then in early years of practise, I shifted my base to Delhi and since then have been practising across various forums/courts/tribunals/commissions situated in Delhi, including trial courts. I had natural inclination towards law because of my family background, being a third-generation lawyer, however, except me, everyone in my family dealt exclusively in income tax laws.\nYou must have heard about this popular conventional advice prevalent in our profession that your first cases would come from your family and near relatives. But as a very interesting contrast, I was only my first client and had to file case against statutory bodies concerned for processing my Bar enrolment transfer request, about which of course I am very proud, especially because I had successfully addressed the Delhi High Court all by myself during the infancy days of my career. It has been more than 20 years but I distinctly remember how Justice Manmohan Sarin, who had a characteristic of encouraging young professionals, supported my cause and granted expedited and effective relief due to which my enrolment got transferred from the rolls of Bar Council of Punjab & Haryana to that of Delhi. On a lighter note, it felt really blessed to start the practice with 100 per cent success rate. Thereafter, there was no looking back and the complete focus has remained on the task/client/case at hand.\nThere is no straitjacket formula and can never be a water tight compartmentalisation with respect to the question of the duration a young advocate must devote to and within a chamber of a Senior/Experienced Advocate. That being said so, as in my career trajectory, I had spent considerably shorter duration than usual with the office of an experienced advocate and was fortunately able to independently stand on my feet in the early days of the profession which could not be possible without the blessings of providence. The same should never be blindly followed by any young professional as what works for you may not work for me and vice-versa. Thus, it is always a wise decision to primarily trust your guts and keep on experimenting which eventually helps you in evolving. Eventually, I gained experience to appear and represent on behalf of Union of India in the Delhi High Court as Government Pleader and also on behalf of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi as its Senior Panel Counsel.\n2. As the Additional Advocate General for Haryana, how do you navigate the dual responsibility of representing the State while upholding the broader interests of justice?\nIrrespective of the fact as to whether your client falls within the definition of Article\n12\nof the\nConstitution of India\nor is a private citizen, the approach to unveil the injustice before the court of law must remain the same. As I believe that one’s ability to protect the interest of a client to the best of his capabilities is paramount, which makes the diligence more important, especially when the State is your client, because many a times, knowingly or unknowingly, effective assistance could not be received without active demand/friendly interrogation made by the State Counsel; as no personal pocket would be at loss if the State losses but as the fact of the matter is, it is ultimately the public exchequer/tax contributor who bears the loss. In fact, in my experience as law officer for the State of Haryana, I have come across many incidents wherein important and crucial documents could not be placed on record because of negligence/fault of the non-supply of such documents by the dealing hand concerned. Many a times, the documents are placed on record first time before the Supreme Court of India by filing additional documents, which itself is a challenging task to get it considered favourably. The Supreme Court rarely exercises its power to take additional documents on record particularly when the special leave petition (SLP) arises out of trial proceedings and not from writ, due to which even the meritorious matters get rejected.\nWith the spirit of upholding the broader interest of justice, I respect and welcome the judicial activism whereby the courts fix the responsibility of any State Department’s malfeasance and misfeasance to that of erring official and not on the public exchequer. It is worth to mention one of such judgments, i.e. in\nLDA\nv.\nM.K. Gupta\n3\n, whereby the Supreme Court had directed the department concerned to recover the compensation-paid from those who are found responsible for such unpardonable behaviour because it is the tax payer’s money which is paid for inaction of those who are entrusted under the Act to discharge their duties in accordance with law.\nIn this regard, I also would like to touch upon a very important aspect of delay caused in the State matters while filing appeals/petitions, etc. to challenge the impugned orders. It is correct that law of limitation does not discriminate between individual and State as a litigant, however, in actual practice, if cases are being decided strictly taking the said approach, it may cause huge prejudice to the public at large, as in State’s cases there is no one individually affected but the public at large shall suffer on account of a wrong order/writ/decree getting finality only on account of delay and not on merits. Sometimes, huge public property is at stake and the courts simply dismiss the matter solely on the ground of delay without looking into the merits. This approach may not be inconsonance with the interest of justice. The courts must have a liberal approach in dealing with State matters and must consider condoning the delay liberally, especially in cases involving public property/public money/allegations of State officials involved in fraud, etc. as ultimately, it is the public which is going to suffer in case of any perverse order getting upheld due to technicality of delay or other procedural errors/lapses. In support of the above discussion, it is succinct to mention the observation of the Supreme Court retuned in\nState of Haryana\nv.\nChandra Mani\n4\n, wherein it has been observed, while giving due consideration to larger public interest, that:\n11.\n…Considerable delay of procedural red-tape in the process of their making decision is a common feature. Therefore, certain amount of latitude is not impermissible. If the appeals brought by the State are lost for such default no person is individually affected but what in the ultimate analysis suffers, is public interest. The expression “sufficient cause” should, therefore, be considered with pragmatism in justice-oriented approach rather than the technical detection of sufficient cause for explaining every day’s delay…\nIn my view, for the acts of the State officials in causing delay (whether deliberately done to benefit private party or otherwise), the State should not be made to suffer and it is the individual who must be held responsible and the courts may order enquiry against the erring official causing delay/lapses and may order for imposition of cost while condoning delay to be recoverable from the official concerned.\nWhile dealing with a criminal matter, the conflicting theories of “personal liberty” and “effective investigation” often comes toe to toe. As in my personal belief, in process of upholding Rule of Law, neither one can be purely chosen by neglecting the other, but it is the process of effective investigation with due regard to larger interest of the society collectively with minimum required intervention to personal liberty, should be the resort. Ultimately, every decision particularly with respect to the grant/refusal of bail has to be taken on a case-to-case basis and no straitjacket formula can be applied while dealing with the criminal cases. As a State Counsel, the role and responsibility should not be to implicate someone or to seek custody in every matter by opposing bail petitions but to render effective assistance to the court by putting forth the correct factual position and need for custodial interrogation, however, without compromising or losing sight of the aspect that the habitual offenders/accused of the given case may cause a threat to the society or witness in that particular case.\n3. You have an extensive experience in both litigation and arbitration. How do you view the relationship between courts and arbitration in today’s legal landscape?\nOn a lighter note, I expect this relationship to be as sour as possible so that there could be minimum judicial interference while parties resort to arbitration except to facilitate the latter.\nThere are countless advantages of arbitration over the conventional courtroom litigation such as confidentiality, convenience of parties, expedited disposal, less complex procedure, adjudicator with subject-matter expertise, less dependency on technicalities of procedural law, etc. With the enforcement of strict timelines for the disposal of arbitration proceedings, we often witness very effective and timely resolutions of disputes every day. The Arbitral Tribunal being an adjudicatory body constituted specifically to adjudicate a particular case only which may have the flexibility to include the subject experts besides legal experts, which is not possible in the case of courts.\nIn my opinion, if the legislature provides some specific timelines for disposal of Sections\n34\nand\n37\nproceedings under the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(\n1996 Act\n) and establishes specific/dedicated courts to that effect, then in no time, our Nation would rank up as a preferred “International Centre for Arbitration”.\nOf course, it is the job of the legislature to provide for scope of the interference in the entire arbitration process at the end of the judiciary, however, when there is a vacuum where the provisions of the\n1996 Act\nare silent, the same necessitates the indulgence of the judiciary to fill up the vacuum by way of judicial pronouncements. The presence of any ambiguous area in any law can be interpreted by the judiciary as it is its important function but what about that legislative vacuum which remains unfilled. If the same are being filled by the judiciary, then it will be quickly termed as judicial overreach, in case it is being left as it is, then it has the potential of becoming potholes in the way of delivering justice. The Supreme Court has faced with such a situation in\nArif Azim Co. Ltd.\nv.\nAptech Ltd.\n5\n, whereby the question of application of the\nLimitation Act, 1963\nover the petition filed under Section\n11\n,\n1996 Act\ninter alia was in issue, whereby while deciding that Article 137,\nLimitation Act, 1963\nshall apply to the petition seeking appointment of an arbitrator and also observed the following:\n97.\nBefore we part with the matter, we would like to mention that this Court while dealing with similar issues in many other matters has observed that the applicability of Section 137 to applications under Section\n11(6)\nof the\n1996 Act\nis a result of\nlegislative vacuum\nas there is no statutory prescription regarding the time-limit. We would again like to reiterate that the period of three years is an unduly long period for filing an application under Section\n11\nof the\n1996 Act\nand goes against the very spirit of the 1996 Act which provides for expeditious resolution of commercial disputes within a time-bound manner. Various amendments to the 1996 Act have been made over the years so as to ensure that arbitration proceedings are conducted and concluded expeditiously.\nWe are of the considered opinion that Parliament should consider bringing an amendment to the 1996 Act prescribing a specific period of limitation within which a party may move the Court for making an application for appointment of arbitrators under Section\n11\nof the\n1996 Act\n.\nThe petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.\n(emphasis supplied)\nTherefore, the collective efforts of legislature as well as the judiciary’s conscious self-restraint are required, so that the process of arbitration may become preferred, reliable and more effective.\n4. You have served as a sole arbitrator and are empanelled with arbitration institution(s). What qualities do you believe are essential for maintaining neutrality and procedural efficiency in arbitral proceedings?\n“Justice should not only be done, it should seem to have been done also.” An arbitrator has to strictly adhere to the said norm and is supposed to leave no stone unturned in adopting procedural fairness while conducting arbitration.\nFirstly\n, the declaration under Section\n12\n,\n1996 Act\nneeds to be submitted at the threshold of arbitration proceedings itself and any fact which may remotely connect the arbitrator with any of the parties must be expressly mentioned in the declaration to rule out the slightest cloud over the impartiality of the arbitrator to adjudicate the issues. The Schedule V as inserted vide Amendment Act No. 3 of 2016 (w.e.f. 23-10-2015) expressly provides for the mandatory duty of the arbitrator to disclose any such reasons/past affiliation, etc. This even otherwise can be read into a basic principle of natural justice providing for a Bar upon a Presiding Officer of a court/tribunal dealing with any matter, which he can be remotely connected with. To say the least, the arbitrator is supposed to make full and complete disclosures regarding any such association with the counsel/party, in accordance with the spirit of Schedule V of the Act of 1996 and any objection arising from any party thereafter, with respect to the independence of arbitrator, may result in voluntary recusal, if the objection is based upon sound reasonings so as to uphold the principle mentioned above. No favours taken in the past as well as none expected in future, can make any office of the adjudicator to function as neutral and with utmost integrity. Parties must have complete faith upon the neutrality and integrity of the arbitrator.\nWith the enforcement of the\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n,\nmore particularly the amendment made in Section\n12\n,\n1996 Act\nand the introduction of the Schedule V therein, have effectively dealt with removing most of the bias from the arbitration proceedings. Whatever scope was left, has also been taken care of by the Supreme Court in the judgments passed in\nTRF Ltd.\nv.\nEnergo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n6\n,\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC\nv.\nHSCC (India) Ltd.\n7\n, and Constitution Bench judgment in\nCentral Organisation for Railway Electrification\nv.\nECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV)\n8\n.\nAn arbitrator adjudicates a dispute so all the judicial qualities are required to fully justify the responsibility undertaken. In order to ensure procedural efficiency in contemporary times, an arbitrator, as well as the arbitral institutions preferably must be techno friendly with the latest relevant technology, as is the Delhi International Arbitration Centre (DIAC). As a person, the arbitrator presiding an Arbitral Tribunal must reflect the character of Caesar’s wife and there should not be any suspicion or doubt over his integrity, neutrality, independence, etc.\n5. Mediation is gaining momentum as a structured mechanism for resolving disputes. From your experience, what makes a mediation process truly effective and enduring?\nIn the presence of able and trained mediators, we are observing that many disputes are settled even at nascent stage, even before they reach the court of law as in the case of commercial dispute where pre-institution mediation has been made mandatory by the legislature under Section\n12-A\n,\nCommercial Courts Act, 2015\n, subject to exceptions. Mandatory nature of pre-institution mediation has already been upheld by the Supreme Court in\nPatil Automation (P) Ltd.\nv.\nRakheja Engineers (P) Ltd.\n9\n.\nIt was difficult to believe how a non-binding procedure can be effective or fruitful but in contrast to all the criticism, it is effectively preventing clogging of courts of law especially in commercial and matrimonial disputes. Many a times litigation driven by ego and/or revenge end up increasing the pendency of the court with multiple litigations.\nSincerity of the parties to the mediation process, as well as the skills of the mediator in comprehending the dispute and counselling the parties towards mutually satisfactory outcome, while maintaining confidentiality, makes the process effective. Unlike the court of law, the flexibility of the mutually satisfied outcome with the help of the mediator guiding the parties towards resolving the dispute in order to reach a win-win situation for all the parties, makes it enduring as compared to court of law. It is equally important for the mediator to gain the trust of both the parties by having a neutral and impartial approach towards the solution, besides being patient, so that a comfortable and reliable atmosphere can be created during the mediation process. To draft a well-structured, settlement agreement, in accordance with law, is an important duty on the part of the mediator, so that the litigation or the dispute may be given quietus once for all. The legal knowledge of the mediator and his practical experience would definitely aid in drafting effective settlement agreements.\n6. Legal aid and access to justice are often cited as areas needing urgent reforms. What steps can the legal community take to make pro bono work more structured and impactful?\nThis topic needs serious attention which should not only be a one-time effort but must be given a continuous nurturing, discussion and active attention. In present time, there is a common and popular feeling that with the enactment of the\nLegal Services Authorities Act, 1987\nand further constitution of the National Legal Services Authority, State Legal Services Authority and District Legal Services Authority under the said Act, the complete responsibility of pro bono work has been delegated and the rest of the legal community is now relieved from undertaking such work. In suppression of such feeling, the importance of collective efforts needs to be revived and some institutional steps are more than welcome to increase the momentum of said revival. Towards the commitment of structuring the pro bono legal work to enhance access to justice, the legal community can undertake several concrete steps by framing and notifying guidelines qua pro bono policies within Bar Councils, Bar Associations and law firms, with clear annual commitments and quality benchmarks, to ensure consistent and organised delivery of services. It may also be considered that the weightage for providing pro bono work can be increased while deciding the suitability of the candidates applying for designation of Senior Advocate as well as for professional being considered for elevation to the Bench. The same formula can also be applied as eligibility condition for the candidates contesting the election of Bar Council and Bar Associations, which may effectively work as an incentive for the interested candidates. After all, the leaders of the Bar, must act as a flag bearer and a role model for the legal professionals to motivate them in doing their bit for the society. The authorities must also increase the budgetary allocation to the institutions providing legal aid so that the experienced and talented professionals may be attracted and retained in the panel and such legal aid panels may not merely reduce to be a learning stage for the young lawyers. In addition to this, collaborations can be done by involving legal aid authorities, law schools and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to pool resources, provide training and widen the reach, especially to marginalised communities. To further provide driving force in the form of acknowledgment for investing pro bono working hours, awards can be introduced, professional credits system can be maintained and public acknowledgments can be organised to motivate legal professionals while integrating pro bono work as a criterion in judicial and professional advancements. The courts must more often request the Senior Counsels to accept appearing for litigants belonging to downtrodden and marginalised sections of society by acting as Amicus Curiae in the matter. In contemporary times, it goes without saying that technology can be leveraged to use and develop centralised digital platforms to match clients with pro bono lawyers efficiently, facilitate remote consultations and track impact to enhance accountability and accessibility. Last but not the least, a codified, organised and most impactful step could be taken on the part of legislature which can incorporate mandates or guidelines that recognise and promote pro bono contributions within the legal profession. Together, these initiatives can embed a strong culture of professional social responsibility within the legal community, making pro bono work more structured, impactful, and integral to ensuring equitable access to justice for all. In my opinion, nobleness and dignity of the legal professional will keep thriving as long as pro bono work keeps flourishing.\n7. As a legal practitioner before the Supreme Court, what are the unique challenges and responsibilities that come with arguing matters at the highest level of the judiciary?\nBefore the Supreme Court, the one strategy which applies to everyone without an exception is that, you have put your best arguments in the least possible time. There is no beating around the bush and the ability to quickly think on your feet, as is already difficult to inculcate, becomes more difficult in light of the fact that there is no scope of any further appeal and this would be the last resort towards the process of seeking justice. Also, the limited indulgence expected under Article\n136\nof the\nConstitution of India\nmakes it extremely difficult for any SLP to get entertained. Whatever is done here will attain the finality which offers no scope of error.\nThe qualities such as articulation of thoughts, command over English language, art of delivery, active listening, in-depth research, justice to the brief, etc. are much needed to face the challenges which the Supreme Court practice comes with.\nThe client is normally not aware of the limited scope of interference, i.e. the highly discretionary jurisdiction which the Supreme Court exercises only where question of law is involved. The client who is litigating/wants to litigate before the Supreme Court comes with a lot of hopes and considers the Supreme Court as a regular Court of Appeal, which in fact is not. Therefore, much actually depends upon the drafting of SLP/petition and utmost care should be taken in drafting of synopsis and list of dates. Often, it is seen that many crucial documents are not filed with SLP at all, leading to dismissal of petition itself.\nOne such incident which I could recall is that in one of the criminal matters where the conviction was upheld by the High Court despite weak evidence, the client approached with a lot of hope and during the conference became too emotional because of his concerns towards his family and emotionally stated that he would die if his bail is not favourably considered by the Supreme Court. This instilling of faith by the client brings too much of responsibility because it comes with a feeling that the fate of the client is in your hands even when you are well aware that in reality only the hard work is in your hand and rest is up to the judiciary to appreciate the merits. As it is the old saying that “the world stands on hope”, and the test of that hope comes to its final stage before the Supreme Court.\nAnother testing challenge is the listing of your case, maybe you come to know well in advance or maybe before few days or maybe just the night before the listing. This can only be tackled with your ability of preparedness in a short span of time and with the team of active associates as well as supporting staff. Particularly in State matters, the State Counsels many a times get brief a day before listing and get limited time for its preparation or for taking instructions from the department concerned. At that point of time, counsel has to be prepared for the matter by taking inputs from the petition itself by putting forth his client’s case at a short notice.\n8. What is your opinion on the growing role of technology in the legal profession, particularly in court proceedings and arbitration?\nFrankly speaking, I myself was very reluctant to rely upon and get in line with the digital transformation which took place more particularly during COVID-19. Even my associates persuaded me to get a tablet for more convenience in handling files, especially bulky case files, but as it is said, “old habits die hard”. It took me considerable time to make up my mind for start using tablet for court proceedings and making notes. Now after getting comfortable with the device and realising its utility and productivity, I can safely say that about COVID-19, that every cloud has a silver lining. Moreover, maybe I should also advice my associates to work upon their persuasive skills.\nThe role of technology in the legal profession can be suitably termed as “utmost convenience”. Now the parties and their counsels can appear virtually to conduct the proceedings. The Delhi High Court has also notified rules titled as the Electronic Evidence and Video Conferencing Rules, 2025 which inter alia provides conduct examination of witness(es) through virtual mode and other rules related to video conferring which apply to the High Court, all District Courts and Tribunals over which the Delhi High Court has jurisdiction and to all judicial, departmental and mediation proceedings. The same has decreased the occasions which consumes and waste precious judicial time especially the adjournment requests and resulted in being a catalyst in the justice delivery system. Now, the counsels no longer have to lift the bulky case files, reference books, bare acts and also not required to turn around pages, all has been replaced by “Ctrl + F”, linking of documents by way of LiquidText app and a click of a button. The judiciary has also changed its approach as now practically every court is allowing the counsels to appear and argue through Virtual hearing and video conferencing (VC) has been accepted as a normal mode of conducting proceedings. It saves not only the time of the counsels but gives them flexibility to appear in a number of matters in different courts in different jurisdictions, which ultimately results in efficiency in the administration of justice thereby causing lesser adjournments. The clients also are able to engage the counsels of their choice who can better contribute in the delivery of justice by appearing virtually if unable to appear physically. It is also pertinent to point out that judiciary also, is considering the service of pleadings through email and WhatsApp, as a valid mode of service which is gigantically reducing the overall carbon footprint of the litigation field by preserving pages and postal-service usages, besides making the system overall efficient and prompt. When it comes to arbitration, more particularly the ones with more than one arbitrator, technology comes to rescue by allowing the parties as well as the arbitrators to appear virtually from any part of the world, thus making it effective and convenient for all.\nThere is, however, another side of the coin that many incidents are reported where the counsels/litigants appear through VC in a highly inappropriate and deplorable manner. One has to also realise that there may be some technical malfunctioning in the application or on account of some inadvertent error at the end of VC operator of the court or by the user himself, resulting in accidental switching on the camera or mic and therefore one has to be appropriately dressed and behave properly following all protocols and guidelines all the times while being online and connected with court server. In this regard, various High Courts and Bar Councils have formulated guidelines to be followed while appearing virtually. To mention, the Delhi High Court has notified Rules as mentioned above and the Bar Council of Delhi vide letter dated 4-9-2025 has also framed guidelines for appearance in the courts through video conferencing regulating the VC appearance. One has to realise that even VC appearance is at par with physical appearance and the conduct of the appearing person should be in the same manner, as if appearing physically.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI) in drafting of pleadings has become prevalent, however, in practice it is often seen that there are serious shortcomings also while blindly relying upon the AI generated information. The pleadings generated is often seen to have been incomplete, with full of distorted facts. The research of case laws is specifically has proven to be misleading, dangerous and unless the same is verified from the authentic journals/sources, citing the same in court of law may result in miscarriage of justice as the AI has the potential to even create fake and imaginary cases giving them fictitious citations and case numbers, which actually does not even exist. Many such incidents have been reported throughout world and therefore it is the paramount duty on the part of the counsel to verify the authenticity of the case laws before citing them in court of law.\n9. How do you think law schools and the Bar can work together to better prepare students for litigation, arbitration, and public service?\n“Exposure teaches as well as inspires.” Law students belonging to colleges/institutions based out of metro cities or where a High Court or its Bench is situated, comparatively get better exposure which makes them more suited to choose career path than the ones who does not have enough exposure. Thus, I would suggest that more and more guest lectures and interactive sessions must be organised where experienced practitioners and Judges could shed some light qua litigation, arbitration, and public service. The arbitral institutions must accept more and more interns from law colleges and must impart them training for becoming better practitioners in their days to come.\nWe have much conversed, discussed and even appreciated about the imposition of compulsory three years of litigation experience required for an entry level judicial post, but what about the teachers inculcating and breeding budding lawyers and Judges. The question regarding importance of on-ground courtroom/practical experience necessary for a law teacher should be discussed. Courses on trial advocacy, cross-examination, arbitral procedure, evidence handling and legal drafting should be taught by senior practitioners as they have an upper edge over the faculty. Frequent workshops, moot simulations and arbitration sessions can help bridge the gap between theory and practice. There is an immense scope of improving quality of education if some practical training/exposure workshops could be organised with collective efforts of Bar and the teaching force of the country. In absence of such innovative initiatives, the cost of law education which is already on a higher end is keep on increasing as the young graduate or a law student, due to influence of a smart and conscious targeting of his/her insecurities, end up enrolling for several out-of-the-college courses which are advertised on the promise of teaching those things which are not being taught in law schools, but ideally it should be the part of a law school curriculum itself.\nAlso, Bar Councils can organise pre-enrolment training and professional ethics modules, ensuring students transition smoothly into the profession. By building structured pathways from classroom to courtroom and fostering constant engagement between academia and the practising Bar, the legal system can produce better prepared, ethically grounded and practice ready young lawyers for handling litigation, arbitration or even work in public service.\n10. What message would you like to share with law students and young professionals who aspire to work in constitutional litigation and public law advocacy?\nThe message can be summed up just in two words, i.e. “be prepared”.\nIt may sound repetitive but it is worth repeating that there is no substitute for hard work. It is a long path to independently deal with a constitutional litigation but throughout the way you need to be updated and keep on studying the ongoing constitutional development. Also, frequently indulge in discussions and dialogues with someone more knowledgeable than you to discover different aspects, scope, interpretation and point of view. In that way, once the opportunity arrives, you would find yourself prepared to deal with the same.\nReading and interpreting law is an art and by enough practice and dedication any one can be an artist. Have a critical approach in dealings even when it is regarding drafting of pleadings. Analyse the reasonings given by the court whose order is under challenge, which would ultimately help in preparing robust grounds of appeal. Two of the many important skills are “observation” and “curiosity” which have the potential to take you to places. So, be curious like a novice child and observant like a forensic expert.\nI believe, “One may feel that there are not good enough teachers until he becomes a good enough seeker.”\nNever use AI-assistant tools as a teacher instead use them as assistant. Do not depend on it for directive tasks, rather ask “how to” questions. Use AI tactfully and instead of directing it to correct/paraphrase/draft a sentence or paragraph, draft it by yourself and ask it to examine its structural and/or any grammatical error. Bottom line is; one should not allow the AI assistance to take over his own analytical thinking, it can offer to turn into dependency which could ultimately have an adverse impact on creative and thinking skills of oneself.\n1.\nAdditional Advocate General, Haryana.\n2.\nStudent Ambassador, VIPS, GGSIPU.\n3.\n(1994) 1 SCC 243\n: (1994) 80 Comp Cas 714.\n4.\n(1996) 3 SCC 132\n.\n5.\n(2024) 5 SCC 313\n: (2024) 3 SCC (Civ) 358.\n6.\n(2017) 8 SCC 377\n: (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72.\n7.\n(2020) 20 SCC 760\n.\n8.\n(2025) 4 SCC 641\n.\n9.\n(2022) 10 SCC 1\n: (2023) 1 SCC (Civ) 545.",

Section\n173\n,\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\n(BNSS) contains the procedure on how to register an information which discloses commission of a cognizable offence. Section\n173\nBNSS\ncorresponds to Section\n154\n,\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1973\n(CrPC). The section casts a duty upon the police officer to register every information which discloses a cognizable offence. The section also provides remedies in case the police officer does not register the FIR as presented by the victim or the informant.\nAs a general rule under the\nCrPC\nand now under the\nBNSS\nas well, there is a duty cast upon a police officer to mandatorily register an information which discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. There was no exception to this rule, apart from the exceptions laid down in\nLalita Kumari\nv.\nState of U.P.\n1\n, in which it was possible for an officer in certain cases to hold a preliminary enquiry only to ascertain whether the information received by him discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. This position of law has undergone a change in the newly introduced\nBNSS\n. Now one exception is carved out under Section\n173(3)\nwith respect to the general rule. For the benefit of readers, it would be necessary to lay down Section\n173(3)\nBNSS\n, which is as follows:\n173.\nInformation in cognizable cases\n.—(3) Without prejudice to the provisions contained in Section\n175\n, on receipt of information relating to the commission of any cognizable offence, which is made punishable for three years or more but less than seven years, the officer in charge of the police station may with the prior permission from an officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police, considering the nature and gravity of the offence,—\n(\ni\n) proceed to conduct preliminary enquiry to ascertain whether there exists a prima facie case for proceeding in the matter within a period of fourteen days; or\n(\nii\n) proceed with investigation when there exists a prima facie case.\nThis sub-section gives a discretion to the police officer who receives an information which discloses the commission of a cognizable offence not to straightaway register the FIR in certain cases, i.e., offence punishable with three years or more but less than seven years, but to hold an inquiry in order to find out whether the information received by him constitute a prime facie case. With this background in our mind, we now move on to the issues for the consideration under this article:\n1. Whether the word “or”, which is placed in between the two clauses of Section\n173(3)\nBNSS\n, should be read plainly as disjunctively or should it be read as “and”?\n2. What is the remedy available to the victim/informant, if the police officer does not register the FIR after finding that there is no prima facie case?\nLegal consequences of reading “or” plainly\nIf we read the word “or” disjunctively, the following results emanates—\nIn cases where the offence, disclosed from the information provided by the victim/informant, is punishable with three years or more but less than seven years, the police officer has been given a discretion not to straightaway register an FIR. The police officer can proceed in either of the two ways:\n1. the police officer can, with the permission of an officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) make an inquiry to find out if the information provided makes out a prima facie case or not, and he needs to complete the inquiry within a period of 14 days; or\n2. the police officer can, with the permission of an officer not below the rank of DSP, proceed with the investigation when there exists a prima facie case.\nIt is important to note at this juncture that sub-section (3) is an enabling provision, and the opening line of the sub-section starts with “\nwithout prejudice to the provisions contained in Section\n175\n”. Section\n175\nBNSS\nmainly states that the police officer has the power to investigate any cognizable offence without any permission from anyone. So, it is important to note that it is upon the police officer’s wisdom if he wants to avail the course under Section\n173(3)\nor whether he wants to straightaway lodge an FIR and investigate into the matter.\nThe problem with this interpretation\nIf the police officer chooses the first option and go for the inquiry, it is well and good, but the problem lies if the police officer without opting for the first option decides to exercise his power by opting the second option, i.e., to investigate if there exists a prima facie case. For exercising the second option he has to seek permission from the DSP. It is a baffling thing that when the whole sub-section is without prejudice to Section\n175\n(which gives the power to the police officer to investigate any cognizable offence without any permission), still if there exists a prima facie case the police officer has to take consent from the DSP. It is an inconsistency on the face of it, and this interpretation makes the section partly unworkable. The consent from the DSP is needed only to do a preliminary enquiry in order to find out whether there exists a prima facie case or not, and not for investigating if there exist one.\nThere is one more problem with this interpretation. As the police officer has been given two choices under Section\n173(3)\n, if he chooses to avail the second option (i.e. proceeding to investigate if prima facie case exists), it is necessary for him to ascertain that there exists a prima facie case and then only he can investigate and for ascertaining whether there is prima facie case or not, he has to necessarily make an enquiry [as contemplated by Section\n173(3)\n(\ni\n)]. So, the police officer cannot directly avail the second option in spite of the usage of the word “or” between the two sub-clauses to Section\n173(3)\n.\nLegal consequences of reading “or” as “and”\nIf we read the word “or” as “and”, the following results emanates—\nIn cases where the offence, disclosed from the information provided by the victim/informant is punishable with three years or more but less than seven years, the police officer has been given a discretion not to straightaway register an FIR. The police officer may, with the permission of an officer not below the rank of DSP, make an inquiry to find out if the information provided makes out a prima facie case or not and he needs to complete the inquiry within a period of 14 days.\nThis interpretation echoes with the intention of legislature. The legislature introduced Section\n173(3)\nwith the intention of giving the police officers a chance to verify the information (to some extent) received by them regarding certain trivial cognizable offence, and not to register an FIR straightway in frivolous cases,\n2\nhaving regard to the nature and gravity of offence. The legislature saved the general powers of the police officers to investigate any cognizable offence, that is the reason Section\n173(3)\nstarts with “without prejudice to the provisions contained in Section\n175\n”.\nCourts power to read “or” as “and”\nWhere the language of a statute is plain and simple, the general rule is to interpret it plainly. However, when the plain meaning of the words planted by the legislature produces inconsistency with other provisions and makes the section unworkable, it is necessary for the courts to find out the intent of the legislature and to modify the meaning of the words in the section to bring the section in conformity with the intent of the legislature. It can be done by rejecting the words altogether; or by interpolating other words. It has been accepted that “to carry out the intention of the legislature, it is occasionally found necessary to read the conjunctions “or” and “and” one for the other.\n3\nComing to the issue at hand it would be apposite for the courts to read “or” occurring under Section\n173(3)\nas “and” in order to make the section fully workable and its objective achievable.\nRemedy available to the victim/informant if the police officer refuses to register an FIR after a finding that no prima facie case is made out\nIt would be fruitful to lay down Section\n173(4)\nin order to address the present issue, it is as follows:\n173.\nInformation in cognizable cases\n.—(4) Any person aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an officer in charge of a police station to record the information referred to in sub-section (1), may send the substance of such information, in writing and by post, to the Superintendent of Police concerned who, if satisfied that such information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, shall either investigate the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by any police officer subordinate to him, in the manner provided by this Sanhita, and such officer shall have all the powers of an officer in charge of the police station in relation to that offence failing which such aggrieved person may make an application to the Magistrate.\nWhy an application to the Superintendent of Police will not suffice\nAs a general rule, the police officer is duty-bound to register the information which discloses a cognizable offence. This proposition of law is stated under Section\n173(1)\n. If the police officer fails in his duty, the victim has a remedy provided under Section\n173(4)\n. The victim has to file a written application to the Superintendent of Police (SP). If the SP also fails in his duty then he can file an application to Magistrate. As already discussed, Section\n173(3)\nis an exception to Section\n173(1)\n. So\n, in certain trivial cognizable offences [provided under Section\n173(3)\n], the police officer will not be bound to register the FIR and he can inquire into the information provided to him.\nFrom the above said discussion, it is clear as a noon day that a victim cannot be said to be aggrieved, if he gives information disclosing a cognizable offence (which is punishable with three years or more but less than seven years) and the police officer refuses to register his FIR. The reason being the police officer has got a discretion to do so. There are two more reasons why the abovestated aggrieved person cannot avail his remedy under Section\n173(4)\n:\n1. The opening line of Section\n173(4)\nBNSS\nrefers to a person aggrieved by a refusal on the part of police officer to record the information provided under sub-section (1). It does not mention “person aggrieved under Section\n173(3)\n”.\n2. Even if the aggrieved person writes an application to the SP, as stated in sub-section (4) itself, he can only see if the information discloses a cognizable offence. On the other hand, when the police officer chooses to inquire into the information provided by the informant/victim, it means that the information already discloses that it is a cognizable offence. This is evident from the opening line of Section\n173(3)\n, i.e., “on receipt of the information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence”. So, it would be a futile exercise if the aggrieved person files an application before the SP.\nRemedy — before the Magistrate\nThe only remedy which the abovestated aggrieved person has is to directly file an application in accordance with the procedure laid down under Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\n. Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nreads thus:\n175.\nPolice officer’s power to investigate cognizable case\n.—(3) Any Magistrate empowered under Section\n210\nmay, after considering the application supported by an affidavit made under sub-section (4) of Section\n173\n, and after making such inquiry as he thinks necessary and submission made in this regard by the police officer, order such an investigation as above-mentioned.\nSo, the victim/informant aggrieved by the police officer not registering the FIR after finding out that there is no prima facie case, can move an application before the Jurisdictional Magistrate and seek investigation into the matter.\n*Practicing as an advocate in Delhi, LLM (Delhi University).

        "content": "The Supreme Court has confirmed that the power under Section 156(3) can be exercised only by Magistrates who are empowered to take cognizance of the offence in question.\nIntroduction\nThe genesis of all criminal proceedings relating to cognizable offences\n1\nis the registration of a first information report (FIR), which is a written document prepared by the police recording the details of the reported offence including date/time, place, name of the suspects, on the basis of which the police commence a criminal investigation. Given the crucial nature of the FIR in initiating the criminal process, any delay in its registration may jeopardise the effectiveness of the investigation, a time-sensitive process, as well as result in the denial of timely access to criminal justice for victims. Despite this reality, police officers commonly delay or refuse to register an FIR, often citing ongoing preliminary inquiries and verification of facts, as the basis for such procrastination.\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court held that if a criminal complaint contains information which “discloses the commission of a cognizable offence”, the police are under a statutory obligation to register an FIR under Section\n154\n,\nCriminal Procedure Code\n(CrPC)\n,\n2\nwhich has now been replaced by Section\n173\n,\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\n(BNSS). Certain specific categories of offences — matrimonial/family disputes, commercial offences, medical negligence cases, corruption cases, and complaints with an unexplained delay — where a preliminary inquiry is permitted for the limited purpose of ascertaining whether a cognizable offence is disclosed, was held to be the only exception to the rule that registration of an FIR is mandatory.\n3\nIn view of the above, all victims or informants of a cognizable offence have the right to seek an investigation into such an offence with the registration of an FIR. In case the police decline to register an FIR, despite their information clearly disclosing commission of a cognizable offence, the victim or informant has a remedy under Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\n, which empowers Magistrates to order an investigation into the alleged cognizable offence on the basis on an application by the informant/victim.\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has issued numerous judgments clarifying when Magistrates should order an investigation. These judgments were interpreting Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\nwhich governed Magistrate-ordered investigations until BNSS entered into force in 2024. Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\nstated that “Any Magistrate empowered under Section 190\nmay order such an investigation as above-mentioned”, i.e., an investigation by the police into a cognizable offence under Section 156(1). While a cursory reading of the provision establishes that Magistrates are empowered to order investigations, it leads to three questions:\n1. What does “Magistrate empowered under Section 190” refer to, i.e., which class of Magistrates are empowered to direct investigations into which offences?\n2. What are the factors the Magistrate must consider while ordering an investigation into a cognizable offence?\n3. The procedural question of how should informants apply for a Magistrate-ordered investigation under Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\n?\nThis article examines the Supreme Court’s judgments on these issues and explains how their directions have been codified in Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\n.\nWhich class of Magistrates are empowered to direct investigations?\nSection\n156(3)\ngrants discretion to any Magistrate empowered under Section\n190\nto order an investigation. Section\n190\nCrPC\nwas concerned with “cognizance of offences by Magistrates” and detailed the three situations in which Magistrates were empowered to take cognizance of offences, i.e., upon a private complaint, upon a police report, or upon the Magistrate’s own knowledge or otherwise upon information received from any person other than a police officer. If a Magistrate could take cognizance of an offence under Section\n190\nCrPC\n, he was also empowered to order an investigation into such an offence under Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\n. The reference to Section\n190\nCrPC\nis crucial as it excludes certain offences from the scope of the Magistrates’ power under Section\n156(3)\n.\nThe Supreme Court has confirmed that the power under Section\n156(3)\ncan be exercised only by Magistrates who are empowered to take cognizance of the offence in question.\n4\nTherefore, if the Magistrate cannot take cognizance of the offence in question, he cannot direct an investigation into such an offence under Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\n. Therefore, when special statutes — such as, the\nProtection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012\n(POCSO) — vest jurisdiction under such statutes in Special Courts to the exclusion of Magistrates, the power to direct an investigation too vests with the Special Courts. Consequently, if the police have failed to register an FIR regarding an offence under POCSO, the informant must seek a direction to investigate from the Special Court under POCSO and not the Magistrate.\nSection\n175(3)\nBNSS\n, which has replaced Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\n, also provides the same discretion to Magistrates empowered under Section\n210\nBNSS\n(corresponding to Section\n190\nCrPC\n), to order an investigation. Therefore, Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\ndoes not alter the statutory scheme with regard to the type of offences for which Magistrates can order investigations. Given that Magistrates can direct investigation in relation to only certain types of offences, it is important for informants to pay close attention to the cognizable offence and ensure that applications seeking directions to investigate are filed before the appropriate authority.\nWhen should Magistrates order an investigation?\nWhile Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\ngranted discretionary power, it was silent on the circumstances under which Magistrates were to exercise such discretion. As the corresponding Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nremains silent on this question, the Supreme Court’s directions in the context of Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\ncontinue to remain relevant in this regard.\nThe Supreme Court has consistently held that an order directing investigation must be a speaking order to be passed only after due application of mind by the Magistrate and if the relevant facts disclose a cognizable offence.\n5\nIn particular, the Magistrate must specify “what weighed with the Magistrate to order investigation”\n6\nsuch as the necessity of police investigation to discover evidence which is not in the possession of the complainant and cannot be procured without the assistance of the police.\n7\nThe Magistrate is therefore required to evaluate the totality of facts, including “credibility of information available” and weigh whether it is in the interest of justice to direct the involvement of the police by directing an investigation.\n8\nFurther, as a direction under Section\n175(3)\nwould result in an FIR, it stands to logic that the Magistrate should also consider whether the consequent FIR would be liable to be quashed under Section\n528\nBNSS\n, on grounds such as criminalising civil disputes, delay in registration of FIR, abuse of process, and any legal bar to the investigation.\nProcedural requirements to apply for an order to investigate\nWhile adjudicating an application seeking an order to investigate by the police, Magistrates often need to strike a balance between the rights of the informant and the potential accused against whom the informant seeks an investigation. While the informant has the right to an investigation into the alleged cognizable offence, Magistrates must ensure that individuals accused of the offence do not become subject to criminal investigations except when warranted.\nTo this end, the Supreme Court has cautioned against misuse of the provision and emphasised the necessity for additional requirements to ensure that Magistrate-ordered investigations do not exceed their required scope. As per the Supreme Court directions, applications under Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\nwere to satisfy two procedural requirements:\n1.\nRequirement one\n: If a police officer declines to register an FIR, the complainant must first exhaust alternative remedies by addressing the complaint to the Superintendent of Police under Section\n154(3)\nCrPC\nprior to filing the application under Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\n. If an FIR is not registered even after the complaint being addressed to the Superintendent of Police, the application under Section\n156(3)\ncan then be filed, and it must include the application to the Superintendent of Police and the necessary averments regarding the lack of action on part of the Superintendent of Police.\n2.\nRequirement two\n: The complainant should file a duly sworn affidavit in support of the application under Section\n156(3)\n, due to which the complainant becomes liable to be prosecuted in case of any false allegations in the application.\n9\nThese procedural requirements have been reiterated by the Supreme Court on a number of occasions with the Court holding that prior compliance with Section\n154(3)\nCrPC\nor absence of the affidavit in support of the application is by itself a ground to set aside an order directing an investigation under Section\n156(3)\n.\n10\nRecently, the Supreme Court has struck a discordant note in\nAnurag Bhatnagar\nv.\nState (NCT of Delhi)\n11\n. The Court upheld an order directing investigation under Section\n156(3)\n, which was passed in an application filed without exhaustion of statutory remedies under Section\n154(3)\n. The Court reasoned that the Magistrate committed a “mere procedural irregularity” in entertaining such an application, and therefore, the order directing investigation was not without jurisdiction. However, shortly after this order, in\nS.N. Vijayalakshmi\nv.\nState of Karnataka\n12\n, the Supreme Court reiterated that “[i]f the Magistrate proceeds without the requisite affidavit, such order/any consequential orders/proceedings can be quashed on the sole ground of non-compliance with\nPriyanka Srivastava\n13\n” while holding on facts that the affidavit proving compliance with Section\n154(3)\nCrPC\nneed not be filed along with the application but must be filed before the order directing the investigation is passed.\nSection\n175(3)\nBNSS\nThe aforementioned case law dealt with three critical issues regarding Magistrate-ordered investigations under Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\n:\nfirst\n, which class of Magistrates could order investigations into which offences;\nsecond\n, when should an investigation be ordered; and\nthird\n, what are the procedural requirements that informants must follow.\nFrom July 2024, the BNSS has repealed and replaced the\nCrPC\n, with Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nnow governing Magistrate-ordered investigations. Section\n175(3)\nreads thus:\n175.\nPolice officer’s power to investigate cognizable case\n.—(3) Any Magistrate empowered under Section 210 may, after considering the application supported by an affidavit made under sub-section (4) of Section 173, and after making such inquiry as he thinks necessary and submission made in this regard by the police officer, order such an investigation as above-mentioned.\nIn a recent 2025 decision\n14\n, the Supreme Court has taken judicial notice of the three alterations between the text of Section\n156(3)\nvis-à-vis Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\n:\n1. The requirement of making an application to the Superintendent of Police supported by an affidavit is now a mandatory statutory requirement.\n2. Magistrates have been empowered to conduct such enquiry as they deem necessary before making an order directing registration of FIR.\n3. Magistrates are now required to consider the submissions of the officer in charge of the police station before issuing any directions under Section\n175(3)\n.\nThus, while Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nremains silent on when Magistrates should order an investigation, the additional procedural requirements laid down by the Supreme Courts in interpreting Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\nhave now been given statutory recognition. Therefore, an application under Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nmust now be filed only after the application to the Superintendent of Police and must necessarily be supported by an affidavit. Non-compliance with these procedural requirements shall render the application liable to dismissed, and any order allowing such an application liable to be quashed by appellate courts.\nFurther, Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nexplicitly empowers Magistrates to conduct an enquiry, if required. While this addition indicates that Magistrates must specify the grounds to direct an investigation, Section\n175(3)\ndoes not clarify the scope of such an enquiry and the factors which Magistrates are to consider. In view of this, Supreme Court guidelines on when Magistrates should order an investigation (explained above) will continue to be crucial guidance on when Magistrates should order an investigation under Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\n.\nThe final change from Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\nis that Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nrequires Magistrates to consider the submissions of the police prior to issuing any directions. Under Section\n156(3)\nCrPC\n, Magistrates could pass orders to investigate without considering the stance of the police. Therefore, requiring Magistrates to consider the submissions of the police is a significant development as Magistrates will now be required to weigh competing submissions on whether an investigation is necessary. Additionally, as noted by the Supreme Court in its recent decision\n,\n15\nSection\n175(3)\nBNSS\nhas affixed greater accountability on the police officer responsible for registering FIRs, as the police officer may be required to justify non-registration of an FIR before the Magistrate, in case the informant invokes Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\n. Further, mandating the Magistrate to consider the submissions of the police officer concerned also ensures that the Magistrate applies his judicial mind to pass a reasoned order.\nThe additional requirements introduced by Section\n175(3)\nBNSS\nappear to be intended to streamline the manner in which courts give effect to this provision as courts will now have to consider the submissions of both the complainant and police while exercising its discretion to direct investigations.\n*Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.\n**Associate, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.\n1.\nCognizable offences are defined in BNSS Sch. 1, which states that “cognizable” denotes that “a police officer may arrest without warrant”.\n2.\nLalita Kumari\nv.\nState of U.P.\n,\n(2014) 2 SCC 1\n: (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 524.\n3.\nLalita Kumari\nv.\nState of U.P.\n,\n(2014) 2 SCC 1\n: (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 524.\n4.\nAnil Kumar\nv.\nM.K.

        "content": "1. Kindly introduce yourselves to our readers.\nI am Jaideep Singh Lalli, a PhD student and Trinity-IGS Scholar in Law at Trinity College, University of Cambridge. My research lies at the intersection of legal philosophy, analytic metaphysics, and critical theory. Broadly, I study how different areas of law acquire their functions and conceptual identities. For instance, what it means to call something “discrimination law” or “social welfare law”. Alongside this theoretical work, I also write on South Asian legal history, particularly on Hindu inheritance, gender, and colonial codification. Before beginning my PhD, I completed the LLM (First Class) from Cambridge and the BA LLB (Hons.) with Distinction from the University Institute of Legal Studies, Panjab University, Chandigarh. Trinity scholarships have generously supported my postgraduate study in full.\n2. To begin with, could you share your journey from a law student at Panjab University to pursuing a fully funded LLM and now, PhD in Law at the University of Cambridge?\nMy journey has been shaped by curiosity, generous mentorship, and a growing awareness of law’s philosophical and social depth. At Panjab University, I had the privilege of learning from remarkable professors, Professor Rattan Singh, who first drew me into constitutional law; Professor Shruti Bedi, whose elective on Organised Crimes and Internal Security Laws transformed how I understood State power; Ms Komal Garg, who introduced me to Public International Law; and Dr Supreet Gill, who taught me arbitration law with precision and care. Professor Bedi, Senior Advocate Dr Menaka Guruswamy, and Hon’ble Justice Arun Palli became my most formative mentors. Working with Dr Guruswamy refined the way I thought about constitutional law and sensitised me to the multiple axes of marginalisation that shape legal and political life. My time with Justice Palli involved rigorous philosophical discussions about what decisions ought to be made in specific cases, which deeply shaped how I think about legal reasoning. Our shared love for sustained intellectual exchange made those conversations some of the most formative of my intellectual journey. Additionally, internships with human rights bodies and with Justices of the Supreme Courts of India and Nepal gave me an early sense of the law’s institutional complexity.\nThat formative period prepared me for my LLM at Cambridge, where I was fortunate to be the inaugural Singhvi — Trinity Scholar. There, I began exploring the philosophical foundations of legal systems — asking what gives different areas of law their coherence and conceptual identity. That inquiry has since evolved into my doctoral project, which examines the ontology and function of discrimination law.\n3. What challenges did you face while aiming for an LLM at Cambridge and what role did your law school journey play in reaching your destiny?\nThe biggest challenge was navigating self-doubt. The idea of applying to Cambridge initially felt unattainable. What sustained me was not only the discipline my family instilled but also the unwavering support of my friends — Akriti Sharma, Bhavyata Kapoor, Urvashi Singh, Ashna Singh, Rashi Shahrawat, Niraimathi Nagarajan, and Nikita Garg — who read my application materials, offered honest feedback, and believed in the possibility long before I did. The habits of rigorous reading, debate, and perseverance that I built at Panjab University, together with that circle of friendship and faith, were crucial when applying for the LLM.\n4. Your published work includes “Silent Histories, Loud Exclusions: Hindu Inheritance and Transgender Personhood from Dharmaśāstras to India’s Trans Rights Act”, “Communalisation of Citizenship Law: Viewing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 Through the Prism of the Indian Constitution”, and “ndian Supreme Court’s Interpretative Experiments: The Status of Compensatory Benefits & Lapse of Eminent Domain Acquisitions\n” to name a few. What were some of the most significant challenges you faced while developing these pieces of work, and what strategies helped you overcome them? What was your personal experience and beliefs that led your journey of writing on trans rights?\nAcross most of my writing, a central thread has been a concern with marginalisation and discrimination, not only as social phenomena but as structures of knowledge embedded within law itself. Whether one looks at caste, gender, religion, or sexuality, what interests me is how law participates in producing hierarchies of visibility and asymmetric distributions of precarity.\nThe greatest challenge in developing these pieces has been working across disciplinary boundaries. My research often moves between law, philosophy, and history, which requires constant negotiation between different vocabularies and standards of reasoning. Writing “Silent Histories, Loud Exclusions”, for example, meant reading Sanskrit texts alongside colonial archives and contemporary statutes — worlds that do not easily speak to one another. The task was to let each discourse illuminate the other without collapsing their differences.\nMy work on trans rights, in particular, grew out of my broader concern with marginalisation; a theme that has animated my writing from the very beginning. The same motivation informed my undergraduate paper on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)\n, which was published in the University of Oxford Human Rights Hub Journal. That early piece marked my first attempt to think about how law codifies exclusion. My views on the CAA have since evolved, and I hope to revisit the issue in the future with a more philosophical lens. I have long been drawn to questions of how the law sees and fails to see certain lives. The exclusions faced by trans persons are not just matters of policy but of epistemology: They reveal how the law constructs and limits the very categories of personhood and harm. Morally and emotionally, I find it impossible to suspend my concern for asking whose realities are left at the margins. That question continues to anchor everything I write.\n5. You have received multiple recognitions at Cambridge, such as the Equality & Liberation Award. What action went behind these success stories and how have these accolades shaped your academic ethos and your perspective about law and society?\nMuch of my work at Cambridge has revolved around sensitising the academic community to questions of decolonisation and discrimination, not only as abstract themes, but as lived institutional realities. I have been involved in conversations and campaigns that push the University to reckon with its own colonial inheritances and the subtle hierarchies that persist within academic life.\nOne of the most significant of these efforts has been my campaign for the removal of Lord Macaulay’s statue from Trinity College’s antechapel, or at the very least for the installation of a contextualising plaque beside it. The Latin inscription beneath the statue celebrates, without qualification, his “legislative reform” in India; a phrase that conceals the violence and cultural subjugation those reforms entailed. The campaign is not about erasure but about context, about inviting the institution to acknowledge that the legacies of empire cannot be curated only through pride, but must also be confronted through truth and reflection.\nThese experiences have deeply shaped how I understand my role as a scholar. Scholarship, in my view, carries a responsibility to interrogate the operations of power; to question how history, language, and institutional memory organise what we take to be knowledge itself.\n6. You have engaged with academic and student communities (given your experience as an assistant lecturer at Jindal Global Law School). How do you approach public engagement beyond traditional academic publishing?\nI see public engagement as an extension of pedagogy. Teaching at Jindal Global Law School, and later mentoring students informally, convinced me that philosophical ideas gain life when shared conversationally. I often write for broader platforms and deliver talks that translate ideas operating at a very high level of abstraction into more accessible reflections on law, power, and social imagination. For me, engagement is about deepening collective understanding and making complex questions feel thinkable and shared.\n7. What are your long-term career aspirations: Do you see yourself in academia, policy advising, public service, or another field and how do you plan to leverage your Cambridge experience and networks towards the future goals?\nI hope to remain in academia while keeping my work closely tied to the public life of law. The Cambridge environment, with its deep interdisciplinary networks, has shown me the importance of research that is both conceptually rigorous and socially responsive. In the long term, I want to develop a body of work that rethinks how we define, classify, and evaluate areas of law, and how those definitions shape the politics of recognition and exclusion.\n8. Are there emerging areas within law that you believe require urgent scholarly attention and why?\nYes, the philosophy of “legal kinds” is an underexplored area. We often ask what the purpose of a law is but rarely ask what makes something a distinct kind of law to begin with. In fact, I think we do not yet have philosophical clarity on what we even mean when we ask about the\npurpose\nor\nfunction\nof a law. I also believe there is a pressing need to cultivate serious engagement with legal philosophy in Indian law schools, where the discipline is often misunderstood or treated as peripheral. What excites me most is the possibility of drawing connections between recent developments in metaphysics (particularly debates about kind individuation, functions, and ontology) and the way we theorise different areas of law (for example, discrimination law, tort law, criminal law, or social welfare law). These intersections, I believe, can open up new ways of thinking about what law\nis\n.\n9. In the context of Indian legal education, what reforms or pedagogical shifts would you advocate for contemporary law schools?\nLegal education in India would benefit from slower, deeper reading and from integrating philosophy and history into the study of doctrine. Students should learn to ask\nwhy\na rule exists, not just\nwhat\nit says. Greater emphasis on small-group teaching, analytical forms of assessment that test reasoning rather than recall, and sustained engagement with primary materials could transform classrooms into genuine spaces of inquiry and debate rather than rote preparation.\n10. Reflecting on your experiences and journey, what advice would you offer to young law students, early-career researchers and professionals aiming for postgraduate study abroad?\nFirst, do not measure your ability by the prestige of your institution or your accent of confidence; measure it by your intellectual honesty and curiosity. Second, start reading beyond the syllabus early; the best research projects are those that grow out of sustained reading, not last-minute ambition. And finally, seek mentors who challenge your thinking rather than simply reassure you. Every academic journey is as much about learning to think for oneself as it is about learning from others.\n1.\nPhD student and Trinity-IGS Scholar in Law at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.\n2.\nStudent Ambassador, UILS, Panjab University, Chandigarh.\n3.\nEBC-SCC Shadow Ambassador, 2025-26.",
